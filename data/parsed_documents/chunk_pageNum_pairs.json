performed pursuant\nto the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, the Audit Act and other relevant\nActs": 0, "AGO\u2019s Audits\nThe audits conducted, namely financial statements audits, compliance audits and\nperformance (value for money) audits, help to provide assurance to the President,\nParliament and the public on the proper accounting, management and use of public\nfunds and other resources": 0, "This strengthens public accountability of government\nbodies as custodians and stewards of public resources": 0, "AGO\u2019s audits are carried out on a test check basis and therefore would not reveal all\nerrors and irregularities": 0, "However, they should enable me to detect the occasional\nlapses in the accounting, management and use of public funds and other resources": 0, "In the case of statutory boards, the management letters are\nalso sent to their respective supervising ministries": 0, "Report of the Auditor-General\nThe audit findings in the Report of the Auditor-General are generally the more\nsignificant ones in terms of monetary value, frequency of occurrence, impact on\naccounting, or learning points for public sector management": 0, "Small lapses should not be regarded\nas isolated or trivial as they often point to weaknesses in internal control": 0, "The Public Accounts Committee deliberates on the Report and, where\nnecessary, requires particular ministries to account for the lapses reported": 0, "2\nAudits for Financial Year 2008/09\nFor the financial year 2008/09, AGO audited all Government ministries, organs of\nstate and 18 statutory boards (selected on a rotational basis)": 2, "In addition, it audited\nfive Government-owned companies and three other accounts, and investigated into\nnine complaints received from the public on matters concerning the management\nand use of public funds and other resources": 2, "Part I of this Report is on the audit of the Government Financial Statements and\npresents selected observations from the audit of ministries and organs of state": 2, "Areas of Concern\nA significant proportion of AGO\u2019s audit findings is in procurement and contract\nmanagement": 2, "Every year we see instances of lack of financial prudence in\nprocurement and poor management of contracts and agreements resulting in higher\nexpenditure for goods and services, underperformance not detected, penalties for\nnon-performance not imposed, revenues due not collected, and little or no assurance\nof value for money in projects carried out": 2, "Laxity in Procurement and Contract Management\nThe first factor has to do with public officers overseeing or managing procurement\nand contracts being inclined towards administrative convenience with financial\nprudence taking a back seat": 2, "Also when consultancy advice is sought, some agencies are too ready to accept\nrecommendations at face value without sufficiently considering the financial\nperspective": 2, "In some cases, officers are simply lax in enforcing contractual rights and do not\nimpose penalties or liquidated damages for non-performance, or claim revenue that\nis due": 2, "Management should monitor contract performance closely especially if large\namounts of money are involved": 2, "3\nAs custodians and stewards of public funds, all public agencies and their officers\nneed to be astute buyers of goods and services": 3, "Lack of Rigour in Scrutiny by Approving Authorities\nSecondly, tender boards and other approving authorities sometimes put too much\ntrust in the proposals and recommendations submitted to them": 3, "They assume that the\nofficers making the submissions have thoroughly considered all factors, including\neconomy in the use of public funds, and fairness and transparency in the procurement\nprocess": 3, "Their duty is to ensure that due diligence has been carried out before public funds\nare committed or paid out": 3, "Many lapses can be avoided if the approving authorities\nare more rigorous in their scrutiny and ask the pertinent, if inconvenient, questions": 3, "Light Touch in Ministry-Statutory Board Dealings\nThe third factor concerns the financial relationship between ministries and statutory\nboards relating to provision of services under contract or agreement": 3, "We have observed\ninstances where such contracts and agreements were managed perfunctorily resulting\nin a lack of scrutiny of performance and unnecessary or undue payments": 3, "For proper accountability, the management of a contract or agreement between a\nministry and a statutory board should not be with too light a touch": 3, "Accountability of Statutory Boards\nIn my Report last year, I mentioned a gap in the accountability of statutory boards": 3, "The Acts of a few statutory boards do not have the enabling provision giving AGO\nthe legal mandate to audit them": 3, "In this regard, the Public Accounts Committee had\nrecommended that AGO carry out a review to see how it could \u201cwiden and deepen\u201d\nits audit of statutory boards to make its audit more effective, and to study the best\npractices of other national audit institutions": 3, "On 16 June 2009, I submitted my report on the review with recommendations to the\nPrime Minister for his consideration": 3, "4\nAcknowledgement\nI acknowledge with thanks the co-operation given to my audit teams

Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Revised Edition) and section\n18 of the Financial Procedure Act (Cap": 5, "109, 1992 Revised Edition) were submitted\nto the Auditor-General for audit

5, "In\naccordance with section 8(3) of the Audit Act, the Auditor-General submitted the\naudit report to the President on 30 June 2009": 5, "The Minister is required to submit the audited Financial Statements to the\nPresident under Article 147(5) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and\nsection 18 of the Financial Procedure Act": 5, "In accordance with section 8(3) of the\nAudit Act, the President would present to Parliament these audited Financial\nStatements with the audit report thereon": 5, "The Auditor-General\u2019s Office would like to thank the Accountant-General\u2019s\nDepartment for its co-operation and timely submission of the Government Financial\nStatements for audit": 5, "In October 2007, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) signed a consultancy\ncontract with the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) for the evaluation\nand recommendation of IT solutions to MINDEF": 6, "AGO noted that a MINDEF officer had certified on a \u201cCertificate of\nAcceptance\u201d that \u201cMINDEF acknowledges the delivery of Study Report \u2026 on 14\nMar 2008": 6, "However, AGO noted that the\nproject was not completed and that the \u201cStudy Report\u201d the officer received was\nonly a draft": 6, "MINDEF explained that the officer concerned had satisfied himself that the\ntechnical work had been completed and \u201ctechnical reports\u201d had been delivered by\nDSTA": 6, "AGO noted that the \u201ctechnical reports\u201d referred to in MINDEF\u2019s explanation\nare of limited value as none of them provided analysis and recommendations": 6, "Based\non contract requirements, the ultimate value of the project hinges on DSTA\u2019s analysis\nof the relative merits of systems and specific recommendations to enable MINDEF\nto decide on the choice of computer system": 6, "The completed Study Report was eventually received by MINDEF in August\n2008, five months after payment was made and which was also five months after the\ndue date for the Report stated in the contract": 6, "This is a serious\nmatter as it is tantamount to circumvention of financial controls in the Financial\nRegulations (Cap": 6, "Selected observations arising from the audits of Government ministries and\norgans of state are summarised in the paragraphs below": 6, "12 million) to the National\nService Resort and Country Club (NSRCC) since 2002 to subsidise land rental paid\nby NSRCC": 7, "(b)\nThe authority which approved this one-time lump sum grant exceeded its\napproval limit which was $7": 7, "and\n(c)\nSuch lump sum grant for subsidising land costs is specifically disallowed\nunder a directive issued by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)": 7, "On observation (c),\nMINDEF sought the views of MOF and subsequently MOF replied that it had \u201cno\nobjection\u201d to the lump sum grant": 7, "Arising from a complaint, AGO investigated into the school cleaning contracts\nthat were awarded through open tender by the Ministry of Education to eight\ncontractors": 7, "AGO found that in the tender evaluation in 2006, the Ministry rejected the\nlowest 11 bids en bloc because they were below the \u201cmarket norm\u201d for school cleaning\nservices": 7, "The \u201cmarket norm\u201d which was determined by the Ministry took into account\ncleaner\u2019s wages, CPF contributions, overheads and profits": 7, "The Ministry deemed\nthe 11 bids, being below the \u201cmarket norm\u201d, to be \u201cunrealistically low\u201d and that if\nawarded the cleaning contracts, the tenderers were unlikely to invest adequately in\nmanpower and other resources to provide reasonably good cleaning services": 7, "However, being below \u201cmarket norm\u201d per se does not necessarily mean that\nthe tenderers are unlikely to provide reasonably good cleaning services especially\nwhen the bids are only 5 to 9 per cent below the \u201cmarket norm\u201d": 8, "In this regard, AGO noted that\nfour of them were past school cleaning contractors and their services had been assessed\nby the Ministry to be satisfactory": 8, "This indicates that a number, if not all, of the\nlowest 11 bids could have been accepted for award of contracts": 8, "The Ministry could have saved between $1 million and $15 million if one or\nmore of the lowest 11 bids had been accepted": 8, "The tender evaluation method used by the Ministry is not in line with the\nprinciples of fair competition and economy in the use of public funds": 8, "An overseas mission engaged a real estate company at a cost of $91,000\n(Singapore currency equivalent) to handle the sale of a property": 8, "(a)\nA tender was not called, but instead, quotations were called verbally, contrary\nto Government instructions for purchases above $70,000": 8, "(b)\nThe evaluation report recommending the award of the contract did not contain\nthe full facts of the case": 8, "The two quotations received each comprised three\nprice components, one of which was the estimated marketing cost": 8, "and\n(c)\nAfter approval for award of contract was obtained, a revised quotation was\naccepted from the selected company": 8, "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the use of quotation instead\nof tender was because of misinterpretation of the procurement guidelines": 9, "The\nMinistry assured AGO that the procurement principles and documentation\nrequirements would be complied with in future": 9, "Test checks of four overseas missions revealed instances of control\nweaknesses, irregularities and non-compliances with the Government Instruction\nManuals and the Ministry\u2019s manuals and guides": 9, "The common lapses included surprise checks not carried out on financial\nrecords such as cash books and receipts (in three missions) and 18 instances of officers\napproving their own claims or expenditures (in three missions)": 9, "The Ministry informed AGO that it had since initiated or taken actions to\nrectify the errors and to tighten the controls": 9, "The mission of the Ministry of Health is to \u201cpromote good health and reduce\nillness, ensure that Singaporeans have access to good and affordable healthcare that\nis appropriate to needs, and to pursue medical excellence\u201d": 9, "The Ministry published seven \u201cDesired Outcomes\u201d and 15 Key Performance\nIndicators (KPIs) in the Budget Book submitted to Parliament for the financial year\n2009/10": 9, "Such performance reporting, required by the Ministry of Finance, helps\nensure that a ministry is held properly accountable to Parliament and the public for\nits performance": 9, "(a)\nKPIs were not published for all \u201cDesired Outcomes\u201d of the Ministry although\nit monitors these outcomes internally": 9, "Without published KPIs, Parliament\nand the public would not know the progress of the Ministry in achieving its\nmission": 9, "The \u201cDesired Outcomes\u201d and the number of corresponding KPIs\npublished in the Budget Book are as follows": 9, "(b)\nFor the Desired Outcome (i), the published KPIs in the Budget Book did not\ninclude the \u201cWhole-of-Government\u201d indicator \u201cHealth-adjusted life\nexpectancy\u201d (HALE)1, which is required by the Ministry of Finance2": 9, "(c)\nWith regard to the four published KPIs for the Desired Outcome (ii) \u201ccost-\neffective and affordable healthcare\u201d, none of them measures the component\non \u201ccost-effective\u201d healthcare": 9, "10\n \nDesired Outcome Published \nNumber of \nKPIs \nPublished \n(i) \nSingaporeans who enjoy

9, "2\n The Ministry of Finance requires that published KPIs in the Budget Book be \u201caligned to\u201d the\n\u201cWhole-of-Government\u201d indicators maintained by ministries": 9, "(d)\nIn respect of the Desired Outcome (iii) \u201cadequate provision of basic healthcare\nservices\u201d, two of the four published KPIs measure service level, namely,\nwaiting time of patients at polyclinics for registration and for consultation": 11, "AGO is of the view that KPI on waiting time is not complete without including\nwaiting time for collection of medication": 11, "The Ministry informed AGO that its published KPIs represent only a subset\nof all indicators monitored internally": 11, "With regard to the HALE indicator, the Ministry would publish it in the Budget\nBook for the next financial year": 11, "As for the KPIs on the waiting time at polyclinics,\nthe Ministry agreed that it would be useful to monitor the waiting time \u201cfor other key\nprocesses \u2026 where it is practical and cost-effective to do so\u201d": 11, "The Ministry of National Development appoints its statutory boards as agents\nto collect revenue from licensees and operators of facilities and amenities on

AGO that \u201cthe errors in the master list of tenancies\ndid not result in any under or over collection of revenue due to Government\u201d": 11, "The\nMinistry also informed AGO that it would remind its agent to obtain approval from\nthe Ministry for waiver of liquidated damages and action would be taken to prevent\na recurrence of the lapses, including checking the master list of tenancies received": 11, "In January 2008, the Public Service Division (PSD) called an open tender for\nthe design and production of \u201ccollateral sets\u201d (souvenirs) for Public Service Week\nand awarded

Tender Board\u2019s decision,\nthe evaluation team informed a bidder (the third lowest) that it was awarded the\ncontract": 11, "By their actions, the officers concerned committed the Government to a\n$455,400 contract without the requisite approval": 11, "PSD agreed that the lapse was serious and would remind its officers to notify\nvendors (of award of contract) only after receiving the Tender

year": 11, "ITE agreed that the level of achievement of performance targets specified in\nthe contract should be assessed": 11, "In relation to LD not being imposed, ITE explained\nthat despite the initial teething problems, the contractor had responded positively to\nITE\u2019s feedback and showed some improvement in delivering its contractual\nobligations": 11, "According to ITE, its intention for the integrated contract was to have one\ncontractor responsible for the whole package of estate management services, including\n\u201cactive policing of operations\u201d and overall monitoring to ensure delivery in accordance\nwith contract specifications and meeting of service standards": 11, "Previously, ITE had\nentered into many different service contracts and ITE staff would check the\ncontractors\u2019 performance to ensure satisfactory delivery of services": 11, "In AGO\u2019s view, it is not in ITE\u2019s best interest to require the contractor to\ncarry out the repair and maintenance works and at the same time rely on him to\nensure fulfilment of the contract requirements, without an adequate level of\nindependent check": 11, "In this regard,\nAGO noted that there were instances where the contractor reported outstanding works\nas completed, or failed to report cases where service standards were not met": 11, "ITE\nshould ensure adequate independent oversight over the delivery of services under\nthe integrated contract": 11, "ITE informed AGO that it would review and improve on the management of\nthe contract \u201cto have a clearer delineation of duties and

of $3": 11, "In March 2007, IRAS increased the scope of the project from reconfiguration\nto upgrading of facilities to improve space utilisation and amenities for staff": 11, "IRAS\ndid not negotiate with the consultant for a lower fee rate as provided for in the contract\nwhere the value of the project to be managed exceeds $5 million": 11, "By not negotiating for a lower fee rate, IRAS was unnecessarily paying more\nfor the project management services": 11, "AGO observed weaknesses in the processing of performance bonuses by\nIRAS which led to a number of errors in payment to its staff in July 2008": 11, "However, before\nthese checks were completed for the records of all staff, IRAS decided to proceed\nwith the performance bonus payment": 11, "IRAS explained that it had proceeded

"Overpayment could also occur because\nof the time lag between payment to an agent and update of payment status in MDA\u2019s\nsystem, resulting in a late payment advice being wrongly sent out": 11, "MDA had under-collected $844,600 in licence fees from a broadcaster for\nthe financial years 2006/07 and 2007/08": 11, "This arose because MDA did not apply the\nminimum charge as provided for in the

seek a price reduction": 11, "(ii)\nLowering Performance Targets\nThe aim of enforcement action is to get owners/occupants of unlicensed\npremises with broadcast receivers to take up licences": 11, "Similarly,\nthe target number of new RTV licences issued as a result of enforcement\naction was reduced by half from 100,000 to 50,000": 11, "Subsequently, at the agent\u2019s request, MDA lowered the targets further to\n71,000 households to be inspected and 44,000 new RTV licences taken up": 11, "24\n(iii)\nPenalty Not Imposed for Underperformance\nThe agent underperformed in the second year as only 54,589 new licences\nwere issued compared to the target of 70,000 licences": 11, "These lapses resulted in a higher than necessary expenditure for the\nenforcement services, reflecting a lack of financial prudence in the management of\nthe contract": 11, "MDA acknowledged the oversight and gaps which were identified by AGO\nand would address these shortcomings": 11, "Public Service Broadcast (PSB) programmes play an important role in\ncommunicating national and social messages": 11, "These programmes cover genres such\nas current affairs, culture, information, local sports, minority language programmes\nand children\u2019s programmes which may not be commercially viable": 11, "(a)\nPromotion of social values, including family, community, youth, sports, active\nageing and

including minority programming\nand minority representation in other programming": 11, "and\n(d)\nPromotion of the Singapore spirit, including Singaporean identity and\nSingaporean\u2019s responsibilities as global citizens": 11, "(a)\nrequires MediaCorp, the national broadcaster, to produce a specified minimum\nhours of PSB programmes at its own cost": 11, "According to\nthe Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, MDA\u2019s supervising\nministry, 67 per cent of RTV licence fees collected are used for PSB": 11, "Public Service Broadcast (67%)\n-\nExpenses related to RTV licence fee collection (11%)\n-\nIndustry development expenses (15%)\n-\nMDA reserves for future PSB and content development funding (7%)\n51": 11, "(i)\nLack of Rigour in Approving Funded PSB Programmes\nFor PSB programmes paid for by MDA (amounting to $80": 11, "82 million in the\nfinancial year 2007/08), it is important for MDA to ensure that the programmes\nwarrant public funding": 11, "AGO observed that programme proposals submitted by MediaCorp were\napproved by MDA\u2019s \u201cchannel managers\u201d": 11, "MDA should have a more rigorous\nprocess (with management involvement) to ensure that the programmes clearly\nmanifest the PSB characteristics identified by MDA and are not those which\nshould be produced on a commercial basis": 11, "There was also no formal acceptance of new PSB programmes before launch\nto ensure that they were consistent with the proposals approved by MDA": 11, "(ii)\nInadequate Key Performance Indicator\nMDA uses an \u201cAppreciation Index\u201d as a key performance indicator to assess\nthe quality of PSB programmes": 11, "This Index is derived from a survey of TV\nviewers who rate programmes in terms of level of \u201cenjoyment, informative\nvalue and relevance\u201d": 11, "In AGO\u2019s view, the survey is inadequate as it does not\nassess whether or to what extent the PSB programmes meet the characteristics\nidentified by MDA": 11, "MDA informed AGO that it had taken steps to enhance the current survey to\nadd more components to the Appreciation Index": 11, "MDA\u2019s \u201cMedia 21 Blueprint\u201d envisions Singapore as a Global Media City,\nwhere media services and projects are created, developed, traded and distributed to\ninternational markets": 11, "One of the schemes under \u201cMedia 21 Blueprint\u201d is the Scheme for Co-\nInvestment in Exportable Content (SCREEN) whereby MDA co-invests in production\nof films which have potential for global reach": 11, "89 Million Not Collected\nAGO test checks revealed that revenue due from 46 completed projects had\nnot been collected": 11, "Under the agreements signed with the respective production companies, MDA\nwould bill the companies upon receipt of their sales reports": 11, "At the time of\naudit in March 2009, MDA did not receive the sales reports in respect of 45\nfilms that had been released for public screening between three months and\nfour and a half years earlier": 11, "In another case, a production company sold a film it produced but three and\na half years after the sale, MDA had still not received its share (amounting to\n$0": 11, "MDA informed AGO that it would review all SCREEN projects to ascertain\nits share of revenue for recovery action": 11, "(ii)\nNo Post-project Reviews\nTwo criteria for the selection of projects for funding under SCREEN are (a)\nthe expected number of local jobs created, and (b) the \u201cbudget spent on\nSingaporeans or Singapore permanent residents (PRs)\u201d": 11, "These criteria are\nestablished by MDA to help ensure that funding is given to projects with the\npotential to meet the objectives of SCREEN": 11, "AGO noted that no post-project reviews were conducted to ascertain whether\nSCREEN objectives were achieved by each production": 11, "The only reports\nrequired by MDA were financial statements which do not show the number\nof local jobs created or the amount of money spent on Singaporeans and\nPRs": 11, "MDA agreed with AGO\u2019s recommendation to conduct post-project reviews\nto ascertain whether SCREEN objectives are met": 11, "In 2007, MDA received $40 million from the National Research Foundation\n(NRF) for the Microfunding Scheme to grow the interactive and digital media sector\nover a five-year period": 11, "(i)\nGrants Given to Four Ineligible Companies\nUnder the Scheme, MDA appoints \u201cmentors\u201d to identify and recommend\nstart-up companies for a grant of up to $50,000 each": 11, "The guideline for the\nScheme does not allow funding for start-up companies that are set up and\nowned by their mentors": 11, "AGO noted that four start-up companies which\nreceived grants were founded and co-owned by their mentors": 11, "MDA informed AGO that in future it would not approve funding for a start-\nup company in which its mentor has direct ownership": 11, "28\n(ii)\nConflict of Interests in Evaluation of Applications for Funding\nTo qualify for the Scheme, a start-up company which has been identified and\nrecommended by a mentor has to be evaluated and supported by three experts\nfrom a panel appointed by MDA": 11, "AGO test checks revealed 10 approved\ncases where one of the three required evaluations was from a particular expert\nwho was not independent": 11, "MDA agreed with AGO that an expert must not have vested interest in the\nstart-up company he evaluates or have business dealings with the company\u2019s\nmentor": 11, "(iii)\nLack of Rigour and Vigilance in Approval for Funding\nAGO test checks found 13 cases where funding was approved by MDA based\non the support of only two instead of the requisite three experts": 11, "In three\nother cases, one of the experts either abstained or gave support with conditions\nattached, but these conditions were not addressed before approval was given": 11, "(iv)\nLaxity in Giving Out Advances to Mentors\nGrants are disbursed to start-up companies through their respective mentors": 11, "For this purpose, MDA makes quarterly advances to the mentors based on\nthe amounts that the mentors expect to disburse in the quarter ahead": 11, "In February 2009, a mentor sought and received an advance for disbursement\nin the quarter ending 31 May 2009": 11, "At the time of his request, he was mentor\nto seven start-up companies, with two companies pending approval for funding\nunder the Scheme": 11, "His request had also included advances for 11 unnamed\nstart-up companies expected to be approved in the quarter": 11, "This means that the mentor obtained unnecessary advances\nfor 10 unnamed companies, indicating laxity in the way advances were given\nout to mentors": 11, "MDA informed AGO that it would introduce criteria for advances to mentors\nto ensure that a mentor\u2019s projection of fund requirement for the quarter ahead\nis reasonable": 11, "MINISTRY  OF  NATIONAL  DEVELOPMENT\nAGRI-FOOD  AND  VETERINARY  AUTHORITY\nUnderutilisation of Facilities at Fishery Ports\n56": 11, "AGO\u2019s audit of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) in 2008\nrevealed that the facilities at AVA\u2019s two fishery ports were underutilised": 11, "AGO\nrecommended that AVA review the layout and operations of the ports so as to ensure\ncost effectiveness of land use": 11, "The two fishery ports, Jurong Fishery Port (JFP) and Senoko Fishery Port\n(SFP), also serve as wholesale distribution centres for fish from fishing vessels": 11, "The\nports occupy 51,420 square metres and 34,540 square metres of land (this is equivalent\nto seven and four football fields) respectively": 11, "Following AGO\u2019s recommendation, AVA informed AGO that it would explore\nmeans to optimise the usage of the facilities": 11, "HOUSING  AND  DEVELOPMENT  BOARD\nDelay in Returning Residential Properties and Land to Government\n60": 11, "AGO observed that the Housing and Development Board (HDB) took a long\ntime in returning a number of residential properties and a large piece of land to the\nSingapore Land Authority (SLA), the Government\u2019s agent for the administration\nand management of State properties": 11, "In 1994, upon AGO\u2019s recommendation, HDB agreed to return to SLA\nresidential properties which were not related to its public housing programmes": 11, "The\nproperties comprised 20 bungalows, 16 semi-detached houses, four terraces and six\napartments at Kay Siang Road, Ridout Road and Hume Heights": 11, "However, AGO\nnoted that as at September 2008, all these properties which were let out to the public,\nhad yet to be returned to SLA": 11, "As both parties were unable to come to an agreement on the transfer price, in\n1997, HDB decided to defer the return pending a study on its corporate restructuring": 11, "In October 2007, SLA initiated discussions with HDB on the return of the\nproperties to the Government": 11, "As there were no\ndevelopment plans for the land and the SLA\u2019s policy before 2005 was not to accept\nreturn of land unless there was a user identified, HDB continued to hold on to the\nvacant land and used a portion of it to store building and construction materials": 11, "In November 2005, following a change in SLA\u2019s policy on the conditions for\nland return, HDB decided to return the land to the Government": 11, "It then took HDB\n19 months for site clearance and paper work to transfer responsibility for the land\nfrom one HDB department to another": 11, "Thereafter, there was a further eight-month\ndelay before HDB wrote to SLA in March 2008 to return the land": 11, "The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has been exploring alternatives\nto coupon parking since the 1990s": 11, "In 2003, it concluded from a study that electronic\nparking is viable for some of its car parks, and provides more convenience to motorists\nas they \u201cneed not estimate parking time and risk being fined\u201d": 11, "In July 2003, the\nURA\u2019s Board approved implementation of an electronic parking system (EPS) in\ntwo car parks on a pilot basis": 11, "At that time, URA deferred the pilot project for a year because of concerns\nover teething problems encountered by the Housing Development Board (HDB) in\nits pilot implementation of EPS": 11, "However, in 2004, because of financial\nimplications, URA further deferred the pilot project pending the completion of a\nstudy to outsource enforcement patrol to the private sector": 11, "URA also informed\nAGO that another reason was that URA was carrying out a study of the mobile\nphone parking system": 11, "The outsourcing of enforcement patrol was completed in 2005 while the\nmobile phone parking study was completed in 2007": 11, "URA should not further delay implementing the EPS pilot project, considering\nthe potential benefits for the motoring public in terms of convenience": 11, "Furthermore,\nmany car parks such as those under HDB, the Jurong Town Corporation and\ncommercial establishments have EPS in place": 11, "URA informed AGO that it \u201chad re-started looking at implementing EPS\nparking in some of our car parks in 2008\u201d and

in procurement and contract management\n\u2022 \nGaps in management of social grant programmes\nWeaknesses in IT controls were found across several public sector entities audited": 4, "The weaknesses included inadequate monitoring and review of privileged users\u2019 \nactivities in IT systems, and lapses in the management of user access rights such as \nnot granting access on a needs-only basis": 4, "Similar issues were also found across \ndifferent public sector entities\u00a0audited by AGO over the last few years, indicating \nthat IT controls remain a key area for improvement": 4, "In the area of procurement and contract management, AGO found lapses in the \nmanagement of contract variations and in the evaluation of tenders and quotations": 4, "The common lapses included approval not obtained before carrying out variation \nworks, and no assessment of cost reasonableness of variation works": 4, "There were \nalso lapses found in the evaluation process such as accepting tender documents after \ntender closing, errors in computing evaluation scores, and not evaluating proposals \nreceived based on published evaluation criteria": 4, "In some cases, the awarded \nvendor could have been different had the tenders/quotations been administered \nand evaluated properly": 4, "For the management of social grant programmes, AGO noted that generally there \nwere established processes for grant application, evaluation and approval in the two \nministries which AGO conducted a thematic audit on": 4, "Nevertheless, AGO observed \nthat there was a need to strengthen controls in areas such as timeliness in obtaining \napproval of funding, verification of grant disbursements, and in the monitoring and \nreview of documents due from grant recipients": 4, "5\nOverview\n(1)\t\nWeaknesses in IT Controls\nThe public sector is leveraging on technology in many ways such as digitalisation \nand automation of processes to better serve individuals and businesses": 5, "With the \nvast amounts of data managed, which includes personal and confidential data, any \nunauthorised access or activity could have significant implication on the integrity \nand confidentiality of the data in the IT systems": 5, "It is therefore critical that the public \nsector ensures that the IT controls put in place are sufficiently robust to prevent and \ndetect unauthorised access and activities": 5, "AGO found weaknesses in IT controls in its audits of several public sector entities \nsuch as the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Singapore Customs (Customs) and the \nMinistry of Defence (MINDEF)": 5, "These included inadequate logging and review \nof activities of privileged users, such as operating system (OS) and database (DB) \nadministrators, and lapses in the management of user access rights": 5, "AGO noted lapses in MOM\u2019s management of its IT security monitoring system which \ncentralises the collection of logs from MOM\u2019s IT systems and generates security \nalerts for review": 5, "For example, MOM was not aware that five servers for two of its \nIT systems were not able to send logs to the IT security monitoring system for about \nseven months due to outdated configurations": 5, "MOM also did not review the activities performed by the OS administrators, who were \nIT vendor staff, for two IT systems that support the processing of work permits and \nemployment passes": 5, "As the OS administrators had unrestricted access to the systems, \nany unauthorised activity could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the \ndata in the systems": 5, "Furthermore, the OS administrators could delete audit trails \nto remove any trace of the unauthorised activities carried out, making it difficult to \ndetect such activities": 5, "In the audit of Customs, AGO found that Customs did not log the activities performed \nby the DB administrator, who was an IT vendor staff, on a database in the eCustoms \nsystem": 5, "This system supports Customs\u2019 key business processes such as administration \nof customs licences and schemes": 5, "In addition, seven OS administrators, who were IT \nvendor staff, were able to use the most privileged OS user account without password \nauthentication in six out of the seven IT system servers test-checked": 5, "The activity \nlogs also did not capture sufficient details of the activities performed using this \nprivileged user account": 5, "6\nOverview\nIn the audit of MINDEF, AGO found that a number of IT vendor staff were granted \nunrestricted access to read personnel and payroll information in MINDEF\u2019s human \nresource system": 6, "The read-access was not granted on a strict, needs-only basis based \non the vendor staff\u2019s job scope and duties to be performed in the system": 6, "AGO also \nnoted that since 2014, MINDEF had not reviewed the log records of access made by \nthe IT vendor staff to information types which required controlled access": 6, "The above weaknesses would expose the entities to the risk of not detecting \nunauthorised access and activities which could compromise the integrity and \nconfidentiality of data in the IT systems": 6, "(2)\t\nLapses in Procurement and Contract Management\nThe public sector spends a significant amount of public funds to procure goods and \nservices, and on development projects": 6, "There are procurement rules in place to \ngovern how procurement and contracts should be carried out and managed based \non the principles of transparency, open and fair competition, and value for money": 6, "AGO found lapses in procurement and contract management in the Ministry of \nCulture, Community and Youth (MCCY), the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura \n(MUIS), and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS)": 6, "These lapses \nincluded weaknesses in the management of contract variations and the evaluation \nof tenders/quotations": 6, "In the audit of the National Gallery development project, a project owned by MCCY \nand managed by the National Gallery Singapore, AGO noted that there were lapses in \nthe approval of 142 contract variations (or 35": 6, "These lapses included obtaining approval from the \napproving authority only after works had commenced or had already been completed, \nobtaining approval from incorrect approving authority, and not seeking approval for \nsubstantial increase in variation cost": 6, "06 million) under six variations, there was no assessment of cost reasonableness \nof the star rates which were based on a single quotation obtained by the contractor \nfor each item": 6, "Failure to properly assess and manage contract variations could result \nin MCCY not obtaining full value from the public funds spent": 6, "54 million), the evaluation sub-criteria and/or scoring \nmethodology used were only determined after tender/quotation closing": 7, "For some of these cases, had the proposals been properly \nevaluated, the awarded vendors could have been different": 7, "As a result, there was \ninadequate assurance that the procurement had met Government procurement \nprinciples of transparency, open and fair competition, and value for money": 7, "29 million), NCSS had accepted from three tenderers \nsome of the tender documents required under the Invitation to Tender (ITT), after \nthe tender closing date": 7, "For the second tender on the printing and delivery of training materials \n($888,200), the ITT did not provide sufficient information for prospective tenderers to \nreasonably gauge the printing volume and price their bids accordingly": 7, "In the third \ntender involving the provision of refreshments for training programmes organised \nby NCSS for external parties ($878,400 for three years), the evaluation scores for \ntwo criteria were either wrongly computed or not properly substantiated": 7, "(3)\t\nGaps in Management of Social Grant Programmes\nAGO carried out a thematic audit on selected social grant programmes managed by \nMOH and MSF": 7, "59 billion was disbursed by the two ministries under \ntheir social grant programmes to 1,058 Programme-Voluntary Welfare Organisations2 \n(VWOs) during the two-year period 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2018": 7, "The audit covered five stages of grant management, namely, \n(i) grant design and setup, (ii) grant evaluation and approval, (iii) disbursement of grants, \n(iv) monitoring and review of grants, and (v) cessation of grants": 7, "For example, a VWO which entered into separate funding agreements for three different \nprogrammes would be counted as three Programme-VWOs": 7, "8\nOverview\nGrant Design and Setup\nAGO found that MOH and MSF had put in place processes for approving new grant \nprogrammes and renewal of grant programmes": 8, "By and large, grant programmes \nmanaged by both ministries had defined objectives and clear service deliverables \nwhich were approved by the correct approving authority": 8, "Grant Evaluation and Approval\nAGO observed that MOH and MSF had put in place processes for the invitation to \napply for grants, grant evaluation and grant approval": 8, "Based on AGO\u2019s test checks, \nthere was proper segregation of duties between grant evaluation and grant approval": 8, "AGO \nfound a significant number of instances where approval of funding was obtained or \nfunding agreement was entered into only after the commencement of funding period": 8, "There were also instances where grant was approved for payment or disbursed before \nfunding approval was obtained or before an agreement had been entered into": 8, "Grant Disbursement\nAGO observed that MOH and MSF had procedures and guidelines for processing \nand approving grant disbursements": 8, "Based on AGO\u2019s test checks, there was a \nsignificant number of instances where the ministries had not carried out adequate \nchecks on VWOs\u2019 inputs and claims for disbursements to ensure that these were \nvalid and correct before processing the disbursements": 8, "9\nOverview\nGrant Monitoring and Review\nAGO observed that MOH and MSF generally required the VWOs to submit \ndocuments such as key performance indicators (KPI) reports and audited financial \nstatements to establish whether funding conditions had been met": 9, "The ministries \nalso conducted periodic audits to check for compliance with funding terms and \nconditions": 9, "Nonetheless, for MOH, AGO\u2019s test checks showed that there were gaps \nin its monitoring process, including no evidence of review of documents submitted \nby VWOs, inadequate follow-up on anomalies detected in documents submitted and \nno follow-up to obtain required documents which the VWOs had failed to submit": 9, "Grant Cessation\nGenerally, MOH and MSF had included provisions in the funding agreements relating \nto the cessation of grants": 9, "Based on AGO\u2019s test checks, both ministries had generally \nrecovered unused funds from VWOs in a timely manner": 9, "Irregularities Noted in Quotation Documents Submitted by Contractors\nAGO\u2019s audit at the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Urban \nRedevelopment Authority (URA) revealed irregularities in quotation documents \nsubmitted by their contractors": 9, "For the audit at MND, AGO\u2019s test checks revealed \ntell-tale signs indicating irregularities in a significant number of the quotations \nsubmitted by a contractor for 49 out of 71 works orders involving star rate items": 9, "As AGO had concerns over the authenticity of the quotations, AGO recommended \nthat MND refer the matter to the Police": 9, "For this project, AGO\u2019s test checks revealed \nirregularities in more than half of the quotations submitted by a contractor for the \nstar rate items for 4 out of 17 contract variations": 9, "10\nOverview\nConcluding Remarks\nAGO\u2019s audits serve to enhance public accountability and help strengthen the financial \ngovernance of public sector entities": 10, "Hence, I have highlighted some of the more \nsignificant observations in this Report to give a sense of the areas that public sector \nentities may need to pay attention to": 10, "Some of the lapses highlighted in this Report, such as weaknesses in IT controls and \nlapses in procurement and contract management, are similar to those reported last \nyear although the lapses involve different entities": 10, "It is important that public sector \nentities avoid repeating similar lapses and implement effective measures to enhance \ngovernance and controls on the use of public funds": 10, "In this regard, I am pleased to note that in its update to PAC in October 2018, the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) informed PAC that it will be working on several fronts \nwith public sector entities to address weaknesses identified from AGO\u2019s audits, \npaying close attention to recurrent issues": 10, "The measures include setting the right \ntone at the top, raising awareness and uplifting capabilities of public officers in areas \nsuch as project management and contract management, and strengthening the public \nsector internal audit community": 10, "MOF also informed PAC that the Smart Nation and \nDigital Government Group (SNDGG) will step up efforts to strengthen IT governance \nacross the public sector and that SNDGG has since increased the number and types \nof internal IT audits conducted": 10, "In addition to measures from MOF and SNDGG, every public sector entity has to \nplay its part to continuously improve financial governance in their own entities and \nto ensure that their officers at all levels exercise due diligence when managing public \nfunds": 10, "I am pleased to note that the public sector entities audited by AGO take the \naudit observations seriously and are committed to taking concrete steps to rectify \nthe lapses and weaknesses": 10, "11\nOverview\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge the co-operation given to AGO by the Government \nministries, organs of state, statutory boards, Government-owned companies and \nother entities audited": 11, "I would also like to express

\ndevelopment project, a project under the Ministry of Culture, Community and \nYouth (MCCY), which was managed by the National Gallery Singapore (NGS)": 16, "AGO\u2019s test checks revealed weaknesses such as waivers of contractual provisions \ninvolving $13 million without due scrutiny by MCCY, and inadequate monitoring \n(including the lack of timely audits) to ensure that the final sum to be paid for the \nmain construction contract was properly supported": 16, "While MCCY was the owner of the National Gallery development project, \nthis entire Government development project was managed by NGS [a company \nlimited by guarantee (CLG) under the supervision of MCCY] through a Funding \nAgreement (FA)": 16, "The FA provided for monthly financial and project status reports \nto be submitted to MCCY and key milestone audits by MCCY": 16, "In July 2018, AGO \nstarted its audit of the contract management of the key contracts under the project": 16, "These included the main

Without Due Scrutiny by MCCY\n10": 16, "AGO observed that the FA was silent on the appropriate authority to approve \nwaivers of contractual provisions and MCCY did not explicitly give authority to NGS \nto decide on such waivers": 16, "Nevertheless, NGS had proceeded with the waivers \nof contractual provisions with significant financial implications (amounting to \n$13 million) under the main construction contract (contract value of $413": 16, "AGO noted that MCCY only raised questions with \nNGS on the basis for the waivers in September 2018, one year after the final account \nfor the main construction contract had been issued and after final payments had been \nmade to the contractor": 16, "AGO noted that approval for the waivers was neither sought nor obtained \nfrom the NGS Board even though NGS had put up a paper in July 2017 to inform \nthe Board on the final account for the main construction contract, including NGS\u2019 \nrecommendations on the waivers": 17, "AGO

the \nproject": 17, "AGO\u2019s concern is not on whether the NGS CE had the authority to decide \non contractual matters but the governance framework behind the decision-making \nprocess": 17, "In this regard, AGO noted that while the NGS CE was given financial limits \nof up to $1 million to approve procurement and contract variations, no financial limits \nwere set for other decisions (such as waivers) involving far more significant sums \nof moneys": 17, "The waivers of contractual provisions had significant financial implications \namounting to $13 million": 17, "There is hence a need

"These include ensuring that the FA sets out clear roles and \nresponsibilities of NGS and its Board, and that decisions involving large sums of \npublic funds are made only after obtaining MCCY\u2019s approval": 18, "MCCY informed AGO that NGS was appointed to directly manage the project \nto more closely align the design, construction and end-use of the infrastructure to \nallow NGS to

\nascertaining whether there has been excess, extravagance or gross inefficiency \ntantamount to waste and whether measures to prevent them are in place": 1, "2\nOverview\nEntities Subject to AGO\u2019s Audit\nThe entities subject to AGO\u2019s audits are mainly Government ministries, organs of state, \n \nGovernment funds and statutory boards": 2, "Government Ministries, Organs of State and Government Funds\nThe audits of Government ministries and organs of state are carried out as part of the \naudit of the Government Financial Statements which incorporates the accounts of \nthese entities": 2, "These audits are carried out annually and they culminate in an audit \nopinion on the Government Financial Statements for the financial year prepared by \nthe Minister for Finance": 2,

on whether measures to prevent \nsuch lapses are in place": 2, "For certain Government funds which are included in the Government Financial \nStatements, the law also provides for separate financial statements to be prepared and \naudited by the Auditor-General or an auditor appointed by the Minister concerned \nin consultation with the Auditor-General": 2, "For Government funds whose financial \nstatements are audited by commercial auditors, AGO would carry out selective audits \non a rotation basis": 2, "Statutory Boards\nFor statutory boards, the Acts of most boards require their financial statements to be \naudited by the Auditor-General or by an auditor appointed by the Minister concerned \nin consultation with the Auditor-General": 2, "3\nOverview\nExercising its discretion1, AGO would audit the financial statements of a few \nselected statutory boards while for the rest, their financial statements would be \naudited by commercial auditors appointed in consultation with the Auditor-General": 3, "This allows AGO to free up its limited manpower resources to conduct selective \naudits on statutory boards": 3, "This approach enables a wider and deeper audit coverage of statutory boards beyond \nthe audit of financial statements": 3, "As current legislation does not provide AGO with the authority to carry out selective \naudits of statutory boards except in the course of auditing their financial statements, \nthe requisite authority is provided by a Ministry of Finance (MOF) circular \n \n(first issued in 1972 and revised in 2011) read together

occurrence \nand impact on accounting": 4, "Minor lapses are also reported if they point to significant \nor systemic weaknesses in internal control which, if not addressed, could lead to \nserious consequences": 4, "The reporting of audit observations in the Report of the Auditor-General is an essential \npart of the system of public accountability": 4, "The irregularities and weaknesses \nreported do not necessarily reflect the general state of administration in the entities \naudited, but point to areas where improvement should be made in the accounting, \n \nuse and management of public funds and resources": 4, "Inquiries by Public Accounts Committee\nThe Public \nAccounts Committee (PAC) deliberates on the Report of the Auditor-General \nand, where necessary, it would require the Government ministries, organs of state and \nstatutory boards concerned to account for the lapses reported": 4, "Audits Carried Out for Financial Year 2011/12\nFor the financial year 2011/12, AGO audited the following": 4, "The Government Financial Statements (incorporating the accounts of all \nGovernment ministries and organs of state)": 4, "5\nOverview\nAGO also investigated 11 complaints on matters relating to the management and \n \nuse of public funds and resources": 5, "Part I of this Report is on (a) the audit of the Government Financial Statements, and \n(b) selected observations from the audits of Government ministries, organs of state \nand Government funds": 5, "Part III covers the audits of the financial statements of Government-owned companies \nand other accounts": 5, "Audit Observations\nMain Findings\nA substantial portion of the audit findings pertains to procurement and contract \nmanagement, and financial administration": 5, "The lapses and irregularities point to the need \nfor the public sector agencies concerned to make improvements to the following areas": 5, "On the last point, I have observed quite a number of instances where the requisite \napproval of an approving authority was sought after contractual commitment had \nbeen made, for example, approval for award of a contract or for issue of a variation \norder": 5, "In other instances, approving authorities were provided with incomplete or \nincorrect information on matters that were important for their decision-making": 5, "An approving authority is a gatekeeper responsible for ensuring that the principles \nof open and fair competition, transparency and value for money are upheld": 5, "On its part, the approving authority, when considering a recommendation to accept \na tender, waive competition, issue a variation order, etc": 5, "should seek to be fully \nsatisfied that those principles are upheld and in doing so, should exercise a measure \nof scepticism in its scrutiny": 5, "6\nOverview\nImportance of Documentation\nAnother observation is the general lack of documentation in the procurement process \nin some agencies": 6, "To ensure the accountability of individual officers and to protect \nthem against allegations of impropriety, it is important that all matters that have a \nbearing on the decision-making process are meticulously documented": 6, "Examples \nare the basis for a tender evaluation committee\u2019s recommendation, the reasons for \nchanging the scope of work after closing of a tender or quotation, the justification \nfor a short opening period for a tender or quotation, the information conveyed to \nbidders, and clarifications or additional information given to an approving authority \nfor its decision-making": 6, "Alert on At-risk Purchases\nIn this year\u2019s audits as well as last year\u2019s, AGO found that a number of Government \ndepartments had been grossly overcharged for projects, primarily as a result of the \ninappropriate use of term contracts": 6, "The overcharging pertained to items not priced \nin the term contracts and these formed the bulk of items purchased": 6, "As there could \nbe overcharging of a similar nature in other agencies as well, AGO has alerted \nMOF to this and recommended that public sector agencies with projects of similar \nrisk profile conduct checks to ensure that the purchases and payments made are in \norder": 6, "AGO also recommended that MOF introduce procurement rules to prevent \nthe inappropriate use of term contracts and to ensure that agencies are charged at \nfair market prices for items not priced in the term contract": 6, "Imparting Values\nI note that a common response by agencies to AGO\u2019s findings on procurement is to \nsend their officers for more training in procurement": 6, "While training is important, \n \nI should mention that many of the lapses found were not due to a lack of knowledge of \nprocedures but more to administrative expediency or preference for certain suppliers \ntaking precedence over financial prudence as manifested in the following examples": 6, "7\nOverview\nProcurement officers should be well imbued with the principles of fairness, \ntransparency, competition and value for money": 7, "It is therefore important that training \nin procurement also incorporates the imparting of values expected of public officers \nas custodians and stewards of public moneys": 7, "This should be reinforced by the senior \nmanagement of public sector agencies setting the right tone at the top on governance \nand financial control matters, the importance of which the PAC had emphasised in \nits report (Parl": 7, "Acknowledgements\nI acknowledge with appreciation the co-operation and assistance given to AGO\u2019s audit \nteams by Government ministries, organs of state, statutory boards, Government-owned \ncompanies and other entities audited": 7, "I would also like to thank all my officers

Directive, national servicemen in combat vocations \n(\u201cservicemen\u201d) who are on shipboard assignments are to be paid a Shipboard \nAllowance": 7, "AGO\u2019s test checks of records of

Contract and \nFramework \nAgreement (WOG PCFA) on creative services for communications campaigns": 4, "AGO reviewed the tender recommendation report for the second WOG PCFA \nand found that 5 of the 108 tenderers should not have been appointed to the panel of \nvendors as they did not meet the evaluation criteria": 4, "AGO noted that MINDEF did not use the correct index to compute the annual cost \nadjustment of services received under a vehicle maintenance contract": 4, "For 2 of the \ntenders, the evaluation sub-criteria and scoring methodology had been determined after \nthe tenders had closed": 5, "For all 3 tenders, the scores given by the Tender Evaluation \nCommittee for certain sub-criteria either could not be substantiated or had been \nincorrectly assessed": 5, "AGO also found that 3 Grassroots Organisations (GROs) had \nawarded or renewed contracts with 2 debarred contractors during their debarment period": 5, "For SFA, AGO noted that there was inadequate monitoring by SFA to ensure that its \nmanaging agents had fulfilled their contractual obligations for facilities and tenancy \nmanagement, and that SFA had received the full value of services paid for": 5, "AGO \nfound lapses at 2 facilities such as encroachment of common areas and blockage of \nfire equipment, unauthorised addition and alteration works, and poor maintenance \nof vacant units": 5, "AGO\u2019s test checks found that the money management practices for welfare assistance \nschemes at 2 GROs were inappropriate": 5, "The 2 GROs had transferred significant sums of \nmoney to the personal bank accounts of a few staff, totalling $707,000 from April 2019 \nto May 2022 for 1 GRO and $334,500 from July 2020 to November 2021 for the other \nGRO": 5, "The moneys were transferred to the staff\u2019s personal bank accounts for cash distribution at \nfestive events and for reimbursing hawkers\u2019/merchants\u2019 claims in cash under a voucher \nassistance scheme": 5, "AGO\u2019s view is that for proper accountability, moneys of GROs should \nnot be co-mingled with staff\u2019s personal moneys": 5, "For 2 community service projects which had been in operation for more than 10 years, \nAGO noted that the GROs did not enter into formal agreements with their external \nservice partners": 5, "Formal agreements are important to clearly set out the objectives \nand terms and conditions of the project (e": 5, "Without \nformal agreements, there was no assurance that the interests of PA and the GROs would \nbe properly safeguarded in the event of disputes": 5, "6\nOverview\n(3)\t\nLapses in Management of Grants\nAGO found lapses in the management of grants by the Civil Aviation Authority of \nSingapore (CAAS), resulting in over-disbursements of grants by $1 million": 6, "The \nover-disbursements were due to erroneous claims made by companies which had \nincluded ineligible employees and non-qualifying amounts in their grant claims": 6, "(4)\t\nWeaknesses in IT Controls\nAGO noted weaknesses in IT controls at a few public sector entities, including the \nPublic Service Division (PSD), PA and STB": 6, "The weaknesses in IT controls included those over the management of the most \nprivileged operating system (OS) user accounts at PSD and STB": 6, "The most privileged \nOS account is a powerful account which grants the user full access privileges to the \nOS, including the ability to make changes to the activity logs, user access rights and \nsecurity settings, i": 6, "It is therefore generally considered a good \ncontrol to restrict access to the most privileged OS account, and to monitor and \nreview all activities carried out using this account": 6, "Any unauthorised activity carried \nout using the most privileged OS account could compromise the application and \ndatabase servers, and affect the availability of the systems": 6, "AGO found that due to \nmisconfigurations of a security software, OS administrators at PSD and STB, all of \nwhom were IT vendor personnel, could execute any command (including commands \nnot specifically approved) using the \u201croot\u201d privileges": 6, "AGO also found weaknesses in controls over the management of the most privileged \ndatabase (DB) accounts": 6, "At STB, the most privileged DB account was shared \nby 5 DB administrators, all of whom were IT vendor personnel": 6, "Having a single \nshared account meant that each DB activity performed would not be traceable to \nthe individual administrator": 6, "AGO\u2019s review of activity logs at STB further found \nthat the privileged account was accessed numerous times by users who were not DB \nadministrators and did not require such access": 6, "7\nOverview\nIn addition, AGO noted weaknesses in the review of accounts and access rights, and \nadministrators\u2019 activities at PSD and STB": 7, "The reviews were either not performed, \nperformed but not properly documented, or ineffective due to insufficient or \nincomplete information in the review logs": 7, "Some of those accounts and activities \npertained to privileged accounts that were granted powerful access rights": 7, "For PA, AGO\u2019s test checks found weaknesses in the management of user accounts \nin all 3 IT systems audited": 7, "When users left service or had stepped down from \ntheir appointments in the GROs, the user accounts were either not deactivated or \ndeactivated late": 7, "Delays in deactivating or not deactivating unneeded accounts would \nincrease the risk of unauthorised access to the IT systems": 7, "(5)\t\nPossible Irregularities in Records Furnished for Audit\nAGO noted possible irregularities in the records furnished for AGO\u2019s checks in the \naudits of the State Courts and SFA": 7, "In the audit of the State Courts, AGO\u2019s test checks found possible irregularities in \nquotations provided for a substantial number of star rate items for a development project": 7, "For SFA, AGO found possible irregularities in some of the quotations for ad-hoc \nworks at facilities managed by SFA": 7, "The spending was for a broad range of measures \nto safeguard public health and enable safe reopening of economic activities, and \nto provide support measures for individuals and businesses in the form of grants, \nfinancial assistance, tax rebates, financing and vouchers": 7, "Part 1: In the financial year 2021/22, AGO audited selected COVID-19 \nrelated procurement and expenditure at 3 agencies, namely the\u00a0Ministry of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nManpower, the Health Promotion Board and the Singapore Land Authority": 8, "AGO\u2019s findings can be found in the Report \nof the Auditor-General for the Financial Year 2021/22 published in July 2022": 8, "Part 2: In the financial year 2022/23, AGO covered the following COVID-19 \ngrant schemes managed by IRAS and STB \u2013 Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), \nRental Relief Framework (Rental Cash Grant) (RCG), Rental Support Scheme \n(RSS) and SingapoRediscovers Vouchers (SRV) scheme": 8, "For the thematic audit of COVID-19 grant schemes, AGO found that in general, the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) (scheme owner of JSS, RCG and RSS), IRAS and STB \nhad thought through the scheme design and put in place key processes and controls \nacross the various grant stages to ensure proper management of the schemes": 8, "Stage 1 \u2013 Grant Design and Setup\nAGO observed that the grant eligibility criteria and operational requirements for \nthe administration of the grant schemes were properly laid down in legislation or \nimplementation documents": 8, "Proper contracts and agreements were entered into with \nexternal parties appointed to administer the schemes\u2019 key processes": 8, "For example, there \nwas inadequate documentation of MOF\u2019s key considerations and decisions on risk \nassessments and trade-offs during the scheme design stage of JSS": 8, "AGO also noted \nthat for JSS, the terms and conditions that would give the Government the legal right \nto recover erroneous payouts from entities were not communicated at the point when \nthe scheme was implemented": 8, "9\nOverview\nStage 2 \u2013 Grant Evaluation and Approval\nAGO observed that IRAS and STB had established clear roles and responsibilities \nfor the various parties involved in the scheme administration": 9, "The assessment of \neligibility and computation of grant quantum were automated to reduce human error \nand to expedite the disbursement of grants": 9, "The qualifying \nperiod used in automatic grant allotment for JSS, and the revenue eligibility assessment \nof automatic grant allotment for RCG and RSS were not fully in accordance with \nthe requirements stated in the legislation or implementation documents": 9, "For the SRV \nscheme, there was no segregation of roles between the evaluator and approver for \ndecisions on the onboarding of eligible merchants or products": 9, "Stage 3 \u2013 Grant Disbursement\nAGO noted that IRAS and STB generally had processes and controls in place to \nensure that disbursements were properly supported and approved in accordance with \nthe intended objectives, and disbursed in an accurate and timely manner": 9, "For JSS, \nIRAS implemented anti-gaming checks by running analytics to flag out potential \ngaming cases": 9, "For the SRV scheme, STB had implemented processes to verify the accuracy of the \nSRV redemptions before making payments to Authorised Booking Partners (ABPs)": 9, "AGO noted that there was proper segregation of roles between the verifying officer \nand approving officer for payments": 9, "For JSS, there is a \nneed for IRAS to implement version change control mechanisms for the anti-gaming \nscripts used, and better document the assessments and approval of risk scenarios": 9, "For the \nSRV scheme, post-disbursement checks would have helped STB detect cases where \nindividuals had made false declarations or where there were fraudulent redemptions": 9, "Stage 4 \u2013 Grant Monitoring and Review\nAGO noted that IRAS and STB provided regular updates to their supervising \nministries and the WOG Budget Implementation Committee on various areas such \nas the progress of the schemes": 9, "10\nOverview\nNevertheless, AGO noted that MOF could improve on its oversight of recovery of \nJSS payouts from entities which had already received other forms of Government \nfunding for their manpower costs": 10, "For the SRV scheme, AGO noted that STB did not monitor and follow up with \nmerchants that did not submit the required monthly revenue reports or supporting \ndocuments for product eligibility checks": 10, "Stage 5 \u2013 Cessation of Grant\nAt the time of AGO\u2019s audit, MOF and IRAS were in the process of planning for the \nclosure of JSS": 10, "As for the remaining grant schemes, processes were put in place \nfor the closure of schemes, including the recovery of outstanding overpayments for \nRCG and RSS, and settlement of outstanding payments to ABPs for the SRV scheme": 10, "IRAS developed an anti-gaming framework and implemented anti-gaming checks \nto detect and deter potential gaming behaviour for JSS": 10, "Checks and controls were \nin place to ensure correct grant allotments and disbursements, such as independent \npre-disbursement audits on grant allotments and post-disbursement audits or reviews": 10, "For RCG and RSS, IRAS also developed a property tenant-occupier network model \nthat leveraged on its existing IT infrastructure and data to facilitate automatic grant \ndisbursements": 10, "For manual grant applications, IRAS made it convenient for entities \nto submit digitally via FormSG or MyTaxMail": 10, "In relation to the IT systems used to \nadminister the 3 schemes, IRAS had in place good IT governance practices": 10, "As for STB, it had made use of the Government Technology Agency\u2019s system to log all \nsuccessful SRV redemptions using SingPass": 10, "STB also implemented \na whistleblowing channel to allow members of the public to provide feedback on \npossible abuse of the SRV scheme, including unacceptable practices of merchants \nand ABPs": 10, "STB had also conducted audits on each ABP\u2019s compliance with STB\u2019s \nrequirements while the SRV scheme was ongoing": 10, "11\nOverview\nConcluding Remarks\nAGO noted that the Government had to develop and implement new grant schemes \nrapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic": 11, "Public sector agencies worked within \ntight timelines and highly fluid conditions to develop scheme parameters and \nestablish processes and procedures for the new schemes": 11, "As the crisis worsened and Singapore went through a series of \nliberalisation and tightening phases, schemes had to be adjusted along the way": 11, "Schemes that were meant to be one-off ended up being run for longer periods than \ninitially anticipated": 11, "In this regard, AGO would like to share the following observations on rapid \nimplementation of grant schemes during a crisis or emergency": 11, "Identify and document key risks involved in rapid implementation of \ngrant schemes\nWhile the risk appetite adopted in a crisis would differ from that adopted \nduring peacetime, it is nonetheless important to establish and document the risk \nappetite and risk assessments early in the planning stage": 11, "Clear articulation \nof key risks, including mitigating measures and tolerable level of risks to be \naccepted, would help public sector agencies achieve a common understanding \nof key risks and make informed decisions when administering the schemes": 11, "This is critical for effective governance, especially since the majority of \npayouts were made via automatic disbursements": 11, "Maintain proper governance of scripts and datasets\nIt is noteworthy that agencies had tapped on their data analytics capabilities \nto help administer the large volume of moneys disbursed": 11, "IRAS developed \nscripts for anti-gaming checks on employers for JSS while STB developed \nscripts and datasets to improve its checks on disbursements for the SRV \nscheme": 11, "As the COVID-19 situation evolved and the support measures \nwere adjusted, those scripts and datasets were also updated along the way": 11, "It is important to put in place version control mechanisms and ensure proper \nauthorisation for changes made to scripts and datasets, as any erroneous or \nunauthorised change could result in omissions or errors in flagging out cases \nfor follow-up": 11, "Improve the level of documentation and communication of key matters\nAs there were multiple public sector agencies involved in the design and \nimplementation of the various COVID-19 grant schemes, it is important to \ndocument the eligibility criteria and rules clearly so that all implementing \nagencies use the same criteria": 12, "Ministries and agencies should ensure that terms and conditions for the grants, \nincluding the Government\u2019s rights to recover any erroneous payment, are \nexplicitly articulated to protect the Government\u2019s interest": 12, "For greater accountability and transparency, public sector agencies should \nensure sufficient documentation of key decisions made, for example, changes \nto scheme parameters and evaluation of appeals": 12, "Acknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge the co-operation given to AGO by the Government \nministries, organs of state, statutory boards, Government-owned companies and \nother entities audited": 12, "I would also like to express my appreciation to all my officers for maintaining \nhigh professional standards and showing dedication and commitment in enhancing \npublic accountability": 12, "PART  I\n(A)\nAUDIT  OF  GOVERNMENT  FINANCIAL  \nSTATEMENTS\n(B)\nAUDIT  OF  GOVERNMENT  MINISTRIES,  \nORGANS  OF  STATE  AND  \nGOVERNMENT  FUNDS": 12, "The Auditor-General

required \ndocuments to STB for eligibility checks": 51, "AGO noted that IRAS and STB generally had processes and controls in place \nto ensure that disbursements were properly supported and approved in accordance \nwith the intended objectives, and disbursed in an accurate and timely manner": 51, "For \nJSS, RCG and RSS managed by IRAS, grant disbursement was mainly done via \nautomatic disbursements based on approved allotments": 51, "In the case of JSS, IRAS \nalso implemented anti-gaming checks by running an analytics model based on various \nrisk scenarios to flag out potential gaming cases": 51, "For the SRV scheme, STB had put in place processes to verify the accuracy \nof the SRV redemptions before making payments to Authorised Booking Partners \n(ABPs)": 51, "AGO noted that there was proper segregation of roles between the verifying \nofficer and approving officer for payments": 51, "For JSS, \nbased on AGO\u2019s test checks, while the anti-gaming checks were useful and properly \ncarried out, AGO noted the need for version change control mechanisms for the \nscripts used and better documentation of the assessments and approval of the risk \nscenarios": 52, "IRAS could also improve on the blocking of entities from JSS payouts, \nfor example, when potential gaming cases were identified for follow-up or when \nentities had voluntarily declined earlier payouts": 52, "For the SRV scheme, post-disbursement checks would have helped STB \ndetect cases where individuals had made false declarations or where there were \nfraudulent redemptions": 52, "AGO noted that IRAS and STB provided regular updates to their supervising \nministries on areas such as payouts and redemptions made, recoveries and budget \nutilisation": 52, "Both agencies also provided regular updates to the BIC on areas such \nas the progress of the schemes": 52, "For STB, it had also established a whistleblowing \nchannel on its website for feedback by members of the public on cases where \nmerchants might be engaged in fraudulent or dishonest behaviours": 52, "Nevertheless, AGO noted that MOF could improve on its oversight of recovery \nof JSS payouts from entities which had already received other forms of Government \nfunding for their manpower costs": 52, "As automatic disbursements carry a higher risk of grants being given to \nunintended recipients, IRAS could also do more to follow up on the voluntary return \nof erroneous RCG and RSS grants to ascertain whether there were any systemic \nissues for the errors": 52, "In the case of the SRV scheme, AGO noted that STB did not monitor and \nfollow up with merchants that did not submit the required monthly revenue reports \nor supporting documents for product eligibility checks": 52, "AGO noted that MOF and IRAS were in the process of planning for the \nclosure of JSS, including the recovery arrangement for outstanding overpayments, \nat the time of AGO\u2019s audit": 53, "For RCG and RSS, processes were put in place as \npart of closure of these schemes, including recovery of outstanding overpayments \nthrough arrangements such as offsets against other Government grants to be given \nto the recipients": 53, "For the SRV scheme, processes were put in place as part of closure of the \nscheme, including the settling of any outstanding payment to be made to the ABPs": 53, "AGO noted that the Government had to develop and implement new grant \nschemes rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide financial support to \nemployers, businesses, workers, individuals and households": 53, "Many of the support \nmeasures were special one-off schemes to address specific challenges during the crisis": 53, "Public sector agencies worked within tight timelines and highly fluid conditions to \ndevelop scheme parameters and establish processes and procedures to ensure that \nfinancial assistance was delivered promptly and correctly to the intended recipients": 53, "As the crisis worsened and Singapore went through a series of liberalisation \nand tightening phases, schemes had to be adjusted along the way": 53, "Schemes that were \nmeant to be one-off ended up being run for longer periods than initially anticipated": 53, "In this regard, AGO would like to share the following observations about \nrapid implementation of grant schemes during a crisis or emergency": 54, "Identify and document key risks involved in rapid implementation \nof grant schemes\n\t\n\t\nWhile the risk appetite adopted in a crisis would differ from that \nadopted during peacetime, it is nonetheless important to establish and \ndocument the risk appetite and risk assessments early in the planning \nstage": 54, "Clear articulation of key risks, including mitigating measures \nand tolerable level of risks to be accepted, would help public sector \nagencies make informed decisions when administering the schemes": 54, "This is critical for effective governance, especially since the majority \nof payouts were made via automatic disbursements": 54, "AGO noted that risk assessments were performed and documented \nto varying degrees for the COVID-19 grant schemes audited": 54, "Key risks, including the risk assessment and level of accepted \nrisks, were clearly articulated and documented, with approval given \nby the scheme owner, MOF": 54, "As many of the COVID-19 grant schemes involved multiple public \nsector agencies, both in designing and implementing the schemes, it \nis important to ensure a common understanding of key risks amongst \nall agencies involved": 54, "An assessment should also be made on whether there are risks \nthat go beyond the main policy owner and implementing agency, \nand how shared risks should be managed": 54, "One example would \nbe an assessment of the downstream impact on the accuracy of \ndisbursements to recipients if the lead agency\u2019s eligibility checks are \nnot fully in line with the scheme criteria": 54, "Maintain proper governance of scripts and datasets\n\t\n\t\nIt is noteworthy that agencies had tapped on their data analytics \ncapabilities to help administer the large volume of moneys disbursed": 55, "IRAS developed scripts for anti-gaming checks on employers for \nJSS while STB developed scripts and datasets to improve its checks \non disbursements for the SRV scheme": 55, "As the COVID-19 situation \nevolved and the support measures were adjusted, those scripts and \ndatasets were also updated along the way": 55, "It is important to put in \nplace version control mechanisms and ensure proper authorisation for \nchanges made to scripts and datasets, as any erroneous or unauthorised \nchange could result in omissions or errors in flagging out cases for \nfollow-up": 55, "Improve the level of documentation and communication of key \nmatters\n\t\n\t\nAs there were multiple public sector agencies involved in the design \nand implementation of the various COVID-19 grant schemes, it is \nimportant to document the eligibility criteria and rules clearly so that \nall implementing agencies use the same criteria": 55, "Ministries and agencies should ensure that terms and conditions \nfor the grants are explicitly articulated to protect the Government\u2019s \ninterest": 55, "For example, there should be written terms and conditions \nto inform recipients that the Government reserves the right to recover \nany erroneous payment": 55, "It is also important that there is sufficient documentation of key decisions \nmade, for example, changes to scheme parameters and evaluation of \nappeals": 55, "Details of the key observations for IRAS and STB, including good practices \nimplemented, are reflected in the paragraphs that follow": 55, "IRAS played a key role in

redemptions for adult tickets": 81, "In that regard, the SCs could have made \na false declaration to enjoy the subsidies for children/youths": 81, "STB explained that due to the short lead time to implement the entire SRV \nredemption system, no system checks were put in place to validate the age of declared \nchildren/youths": 81, "There were also challenges in implementing effective system checks \nsuch as difficulties in verifying the identities of such persons through MyInfo as they \ndid not have SingPass accounts": 81, "AGO also found 35 redemptions (disbursements totalling $2,600) made using \nSingPass accounts of 30 persons who were deceased at the point of redemption": 81, "6 months after the date of death registration \nof the persons, while 17 redemptions were made on the

who had not conducted proper facial verification checks": 81, "The \nremaining 31 redemptions were due to delays in deactivating the deceased persons\u2019 \nSingPass accounts, that had allowed other persons to misuse the SingPass accounts \nof the deceased persons to make the redemptions": 81, "While AGO understands the challenges faced by STB in implementing \nreal-time checks to detect persons gaming the SRV scheme, AGO is of the view \nthat post-disbursement checks would have helped STB detect instances where \npersons had made false declarations or fraudulent redemptions": 82, "STB explained that it had designed the SRV scheme to be as seamless as \npossible for SCs and hence decided to rely on declarations by adults when redeeming \nthe child/youth subsidies": 82, "STB would consider the feasibility of ascertaining the \nidentities of children/youths and their familial relationships, should there be such a \nrequirement for future schemes": 82, "STB would also consider

proper monitoring and timely \nfollow-up on compliance with its terms and conditions for future schemes": 83, "12 The revenue reports were for monitoring the corporate health of the merchants on the SRV scheme, \nwhich was 1 of the indicators to be tracked by STB to ensure that the SRV scheme objectives were \nmet": 83, "AGO noted that there were inadequate access controls over STB\u2019s intranet \npages where the merchant and product whitelists were maintained": 84, "The merchant \nand product whitelists were used by STB\u2019s automated script to ascertain whether \nthe transactions

access to the merchant \nwhitelist, and 655 STB officers with read and write access to the product whitelist": 84, "According to STB, the creators of the intranet pages decided who should \nhave

conduct monthly reviews of access rights and regular reviews of activity \nlogs on changes made": 84, "STB used the Singapore Tourism Analytical Network (STAN) Database (DB) \nhoused in 2 servers to store the SRV redemption data": 85, "The data would be reconciled \nwith the transaction data received from the ABPs to ensure the completeness, accuracy \nand validity of the redemptions prior to

\nto perform their daily duties": 86, "The configurations of the security software were also \nnot in compliance with a GovTech advisory dated 1 June 2020": 86, "AGO noted that STB did not review the

AGO has consciously \nshifted the emphasis for this year\u2019s audits to other areas": 3, "However, as procurement \nof goods and services entails a significant commitment of financial resources in the \npublic sector every year, AGO would still audit procurements selectively and report \nthe more significant lapses found": 3, "In this year\u2019s audits, AGO observed instances of lapses in the administration of grants, \nschemes and programmes which raised concerns over whether public funds were \nused appropriately": 3, "In this Overview, I would like to highlight the following areas where public sector \nentities could pay greater attention to and where improvements could be made": 3, "Administration of Grants\nPublic sector entities administer a wide range of grants to achieve specific policy \nobjectives": 3, "As public funds are expended for the grants, there should be proper \ncontrols on the evaluation, implementation and monitoring process to ensure that \ngrants are used for the purposes intended and in the manner prescribed": 3, "A public sector \nentity was lax in monitoring the submission of project deliverables by grant recipients, \nwhich defeated the purpose of requiring recipients to meet specified milestones": 4, "The entity had also made full disbursement of grants before completion of the last \nmilestone for certain projects": 4, "AGO\u2019s test checks, following a complaint on grants \nadministered by the entity, also revealed lapses in the evaluation of projects for \nfunding": 4, "There was no evidence that some of the projects approved for funding \nhad met the criteria and hence, there could be doubts as to whether these projects \nshould be funded": 4, "Commitment of Public Funds\nWhen committing public funds for projects or to pay for products or services, public \nsector entities should ensure that the expenditure is justified": 4, "An entity was found to have expended public funds on two \nprojects to allow the entity\u2019s testing methods and facilities to be ISO (International \nOrganization for Standardization) accredited only to discover subsequently that \nthe accreditation was not necessary": 4, "This is an indication that proper \nevaluation might not have been carried out prior to commitment of funds and \nimplementation of the projects": 4, "In another instance, an entity had made full payment

broad guidelines \nfor determining the types of funding to be given under a programme": 5, "As land is a valuable \nresource, these entities are expected to manage such land in accordance with the \nlaw and Government policy objectives": 5, "For proper management and regulation of \nland resources, it is important that all uses of land are properly covered by licence or \nlease agreements to protect the rights of the various parties, should any dispute arise": 5, "In addition, public resources such as land, buildings and assets should as far as \npossible be put to good use to minimise wastage": 5, "6\nOverview\nAGO noted from an audit that subsequent changes in land size and land use of an \narea licensed to a public sector entity were not updated in the licence agreement": 6, "Furthermore, contrary to Government policy, the entity had sublet part of the land to \nits contractor for many years at a nominal rent instead of charging fair market value, \neffectively providing a rental subsidy to the commercial entity": 6, "AGO\u2019s audit also found indications of under-utilisation of land, buildings and \nfacilities at two of the sites managed by a public sector entity": 6, "Test checks of assets held by the entity also revealed a number of \nequipment and machinery that were rarely or not used for a number of years": 6, "There \nshould be greater supervision over the management of assets to ensure that assets are \npurchased only when needed and assets no longer required are disposed of promptly \nto realise any salvage value": 49, "Procurement\nPublic sector entities spend significant amounts from their budgets for purchases \nof goods and services": 6, "In order to ensure that public funds are spent prudently, \nthe entities are expected to adhere to the principles of transparency, open and fair \ncompetition and value for money in their procurements": 6, "AGO\u2019s audits revealed weaknesses and irregularities at various stages of procurement \nin a public sector entity": 6, "This entity had adopted significantly different procurement \nprocedures from the Government procurement procedures which the entity was \nrequired to comply with": 6, "For example, the entity\u2019s procedures only required three \nquotes to be obtained when similar purchases would have to be made via open \nquotations under Government procurement procedures": 6, "AGO\u2019s test checks revealed \ninstances of contracts awarded through waiver of competition without compelling \nreasons": 6, "There were also irregularities in sourcing for quotations, lapses in evaluation \nof quotations and payments without adequate evidence that the goods or services \nhad been received": 6, "As a result, there was no assurance that this entity had obtained value for money for \nits purchases": 6, "The failure to ensure open and fair competition could also subject the \nentity to allegations of unfairness and lack of transparency": 6, "7\nOverview\nAGO\u2019s test checks of three projects undertaken by another entity revealed irregularities \nin the management of variation works": 7, "For all three projects, prior approvals were \nnot sought for variation works carried out and for increase in project costs which \nexceeded the approved procurement values": 7, "For one project, instructions for most \nvariation works were either not issued or issued to the contractors many months after \nthe project was completed": 7, "By failing to seek prior approvals, the entity had undermined the role of the approving \nauthorities and bypassed controls to ensure that variations were justified before \nimplementation": 7, "There was also the risk that the works carried out might not be in \naccordance with the entity\u2019s requirements": 7, "Creating and Backdating Documents Furnished for Audit\nIn addition to the above observations, I would like to highlight my concern over a \ncase where documents were created to satisfy audit queries": 7, "The effectiveness of audits is dependent on public sector entities furnishing evidence \nthat reflects truly the events or processes that had taken place": 7, "For an audit carried out this year, AGO found indications that some of the documents \nfurnished for audits were created and backdated to give the impression that they \nexisted at the time when the relevant transactions took place": 7, "An internal inquiry conducted by the supervising ministry of the audited entity \nconfirmed that an officer had created and backdated letters, purportedly issued by \nthe entity to its suppliers, to satisfy AGO\u2019s queries": 7, "AGO takes a serious view of such actions which hamper AGO in performing its \nstatutory duties effectively and weaken the system of accountability": 7, "The supervising \nministry informed AGO that it took a serious view of the irregularity and would be \ntaking disciplinary action against the officer": 7, "8\nOverview\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to

know the amount of handling fees charged \nby and paid to the travel agents": 17, "This was because the agents\u2019 quotes neither indicated \nthe handling fees to be charged nor confirmed that the handling fees stipulated in the \nframework agreement would be charged, and their invoices also did not show the \nhandling fees charged as a separate item": 17, "There was thus no assurance that

that due to incomplete data \nprovided by several agencies, CPFB did not have a complete set of divorce records \nrequired for assessing workers\u2019 eligibility for WIS": 46, "As a result, there would be \nworkers who were divorced yet reflected as married in CPFB\u2019s records and deemed \nineligible for 2013 WIS benefits due to consideration of the property and income of \nthe ex-spouse":

"AGO\u2019s test checks of 19 cases where quotes were sourced manually revealed \nirregularities in sourcing for 13 cases (totalling $395,300), which could render the \nprocurement process susceptible

were not evaluated based on \nlike-for-like comparison and some quotes which met critical evaluation criteria were \nomitted from evaluation": 53, "As a result, there was no assurance that the quotes were \nevaluated in a fair and transparent manner, and those recommended and selected for \naward were the ones most advantageous to the Government": 53, "From test checks, AGO observed four cases (totalling $431,000) where the \ncommittees which had evaluated the quotations also approved the award of quotations": 53, "Test checks also revealed 10 contracts (totalling $453,500) where the

to avoid or minimise risks of mistakes and manipulation": 53, "AGO\u2019s test checks revealed four payments (totalling $362,100) where there \nwere neither supporting documents, such as delivery

allegations of unfairness and lack of transparency": 53, "NCSS\u2019 justifications for inviting a single vendor to quote were weak \nand there was no evidence to show that the invited vendor was the \nonly company which was able to provide the services required": 54, "NCSS started receiving services from the vendor six months before \nobtaining the approval to award the quotation to the vendor": 54, "There was no evidence that a member of the event\u2019s organising \ncommittee, who had a vested interest in this purchase, had abstained \nfrom involvement in decisions on the choice of vendor": 54, "In fact, one \nof the justifications used by NCSS for waiving competition was that \nthe member had recommended this vendor": 54, "NCSS informed AGO that since April 2013, it has taken steps to tighten its \ninternal controls and put in place a sound governance framework for its procurement": 54, "This included the mandatory use of the Government Electronic Business portal \nas the default

Ministry, the homes and activity centre \nalso receive donations from the public": 8, "As the MA agreements do not specify the treatment of donations vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe grants, the MAs may use the donations for expenditure already covered by the \ngrants from the Ministry": 8, "This may have the unintended effect of allowing donations \nto be retained by the MAs in the form of unspent grants": 8, "The Ministry informed AGO that when the outcome-based funding policy \nfor MAs was first implemented, donation was not an issue as the amounts involved \nthen were small and insignificant": 8, "In

consumption had allowed the irregularities to occur": 9, "Following AGO\u2019s findings, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) convened \na Higher Board of Inquiry (HBOI) to investigate into the findings

circulated to the ILTC institutions, and briefings that were conducted by MOF \nfor the institutions, made it clear that the payouts belonged to the patients": 10, "AGO observed that one home treated the money as its revenue \nwhile the other five homes used the money to pay for medical treatment, consumables \nand charges incurred by the respective patients without the patients\u2019

criteria for the allocation and \nrenewal of tenancies under the AHS so as to optimise the use of its funding resources \nwhile achieving the objectives of the AHS": 17, "NAC agreed with AGO that the criteria for allocation and renewal of tenancies \ncould be improved to ensure that resources are more effectively channelled to \ndeserving artists and arts groups and that the level of support can be adjusted to better \nmeet their specific needs and stage of development": 17, "Following a review, NAC had \nimplemented a pilot project in end 2008 to make facilities available to a larger group

Government revenue contracting procedures, notwithstanding that the \nrental was based on market valuation": 17, "AGO also observed irregularities in NAC\u2019s submissions to its Tender Board \nseeking extensions of tenancy for the cafe operator": 17, "These include wrongly stating \nthat the Government revenue contracting procedures allow extensions of tenancy \nfor up to nine years and failing to comply with a decision by the Tender Board that \nthe third tenancy should be the last extension with the same operator": 17, "NAC agreed that tenancies should be awarded on the basis of

there are \nstrong reasons for doing so": 17, "A circular had been issued to staff to emphasise the need to comply \nwith the seven-day quotation opening period, and if the opening period is less than

safeguarded and public funds and \nresources are properly used, managed and accounted for": 17, "AGO therefore conducted \na horizontal audit across statutory boards to identify any gaps or

adopting it as a guide for statutory boards upon which to model their own \ngovernance framework and processes": 17, "AGO also recommended that MOF consider providing a template on the \ngovernance

carried \nout by its IT vendors on eight specific days in a year": 25, "As the IT vendors would \naccess the IPTOBis servers several times a day to perform maintenance, the extent of \nMinLaw\u2019s monitoring was ineffective in detecting unauthorised access and changes \n \nto IPTOBis data": 25, "In addition, AGO\u2019s review of access controls as at October 2015 revealed \n \nthat 44 user accounts provided to its IT vendors to set up the servers in October 2014 \nhad not been removed, even though these accounts were no longer required": 25, "AGO \nfurther noted that another seven accounts held by its IT vendors were assigned \nexcessive access rights which would allow them to modify IPTOBis data": 25, "If the IT \nvendors were to carry out unauthorised modifications to the data stored in the servers, \nthe integrity of the data might be compromised": 25, "MinLaw informed AGO that it has since taken action to tighten the access \nrights granted to its IT vendors and has

March 2014, did not \nevaluate whether the DGS could integrate with the FDWS which was to be developed \nseparately": 26, "MOM subsequently found out in November 2014, when the DGS was \ndelivered, that it could not be integrated with the FDWS": 26, "MOM then decided not \nto use the DGS as it would not be cost effective to make the required modifications": 26, "However, AGO noted that there was no documentary evidence that MOM had put \nup any plans to redeploy the unused DGS assets": 26, "There were only some working \nlevel discussions on the redeployment, which eventually did not materialise": 26, "A number of the DGS assets (such as hardware servers, database licences) \ncould have been redeployed for other uses within MOM or other government \nagencies": 26, "Not doing so would result in a waste of public funds as the usability of these \nassets would be reduced with the lapse of time, due to technology obsolescence or \n \nexpiry of licences": 26, "MOM acknowledged

Private Limited \n(NYPi)2": 33, "NYP did not have any guidelines for the members of its Board of Governors \n(BOG) to properly manage conflict of interest situations in dealing with subsidiaries": 33, "AGO noted that some BOG members with vested interests in NYPi were involved \nin the evaluation and decision-making process on matters relating to NYPi": 33, "In this \nregard, the BOG had approved a funding model for NYPi that was more generous \nthan that provided for in Government\u2019s instructions": 33, "In addition, NYP did not charge \nmarket rates for premises used by NYPi and had given funding in excess of that \napproved by the BOG, resulting in NYPi being provided with hidden subsidies and \nexcess funds totalling $8": 33, "Without a proper framework to manage conflict of interest, there \nwas no assurance that decisions on transactions with its subsidiary were made in \nan objective and impartial manner": 33, "In addition, the provision of generous funding \nterms, excess funding and hidden subsidies lacked transparency, and also distorted \nNYPi\u2019s financial state of affairs, making it difficult for the Government to assess the \ntrue financial performance and viability of NYPi": 33, "NYP did not set any rules or guidelines requiring its BOG members to \nabstain from involvement in transactions with its subsidiaries for which they have \na vested interest": 33, "AGO noted that two senior officers of NYP (who were NYP\u2019s \nBOG members) and three other BOG members who were directors of NYPi, had \nparticipated in the evaluation, discussion and decision-making relating to the funding \nof NYPi and other transactions with NYPi": 33, "This practice contravened the principle \nof good governance, which requires Board members to avoid putting themselves in \npositions of actual or perceived conflict of interest and to abstain from being involved \nin transactions in which they have a vested interest": 33, "One of the two senior

NYP\u2019s BOG for approval": 34, "In addition, \nthere was no evidence that he and three other NYP BOG members, \nwho were also directors of NYPi, had abstained from participating \nin the discussion and decision-making on this matter": 34, "In this regard, \nAGO noted that the approved funding was more generous than that \nallowed under Government\u2019s instructions (see details in paragraphs 26 \n \nand 27)": 34, "The senior officer (mentioned in paragraph 24b) had on several \noccasions given approvals for NYPi to use NYP\u2019s premises without \npaying rental or paying rental at below market rate": 34, "These approvals \nresulted in hidden subsidies being provided to NYPi (see details in \nparagraphs 29 and 30)": 34, "NYP indicated that it would put in place a proper governance framework for \nits BOG members on the handling of transactions with NYP\u2019s subsidiaries": 34, "This \nwould include requiring BOG members with potential conflict of interest to recuse \nthemselves from the decision-making process": 34, "AGO\u2019s audit revealed that NYP had given funds to NYPi without requiring \nrepayment of the funds or market rate of returns on the funds": 34, "Such a funding \narrangement is not compliant with Government\u2019s instructions requiring that funding \nto subsidiaries be provided by means of loan or equity and that returns in the form \nof interests or dividends be made on the funding provided": 34, "Instead, NYPi was given \ndiscretion to make donations and sponsorships to NYP with the timing, amounts and \nusage determined by NYPi": 34, "The bulk of these returns in the form of donations made \nby NYPi had allowed it to claim tax deductions and hence lower its tax liability": 34, "The \nimproper funding arrangement and the subsequent arrangement of allowing NYPi \nto make returns at its discretion lacked transparency and financial accountability": 34, "54 million were \ndonations to NYP\u2019s Nanyang Polytechnic Education Fund (an Institution of a Public \nCharacter) that had enabled NYPi to claim tax deductions": 35, "NYP informed AGO that it had since stopped the funding arrangement from \nApril 2016 and would not be receiving new donations from NYPi": 35, "AGO\u2019s checks revealed that NYP had either not charged NYPi rental or \ncharged rental that was below market rate for using its premises": 35, "NYP did not carry out the transactions at arm\u2019s length and \nwas effectively providing hidden subsidies to NYPi, which totalled $3": 35, "NYP\u2019s practices are contrary to Government\u2019s instructions that statutory \nboards\u2019 interaction with others shall be guided by the principles of openness and \ntransparency, and relationships with Government-linked enterprises shall always be \nat arm\u2019s length": 35, "The hidden subsidies would distort the financial state of affairs of \nNYPi, and hinder proper assessment of the true financial performance and viability \nof NYPi": 35, "For example, NYP had provided funding for part \nof NYPi\u2019s revenue-generating activities, although the approved funding basis stated \nthat such activities would not be funded": 35, "Providing funding in excess of the approved amount undermines the role \nof the approving authority and bypasses the controls put in place to ensure that all \nfunding provided to external organisations are properly justified": 36, "Following AGO\u2019s audit, NYP indicated that it would inform its BOG of the \nexcess funding and seek the BOG\u2019s decision on the action to take": 36, "AGO found that NYP had allowed the name of Nanyang Polytechnic \nEducation Fund (the Fund), an Institution of a Public Character (IPC), to be used \nto solicit donations (amounting to $286,300) for a purpose not authorised under \nthe Fund": 36, "Such irregular practices could also tarnish NYP\u2019s reputation and erode the trust and \nconfidence of donors and the public in NYP\u2019s financial management": 36, "NYP allowed the Fund\u2019s name to be used even though the donations were solicited \nfor a purpose not authorised under the Fund": 36, "NYP then issued tax deduction receipts \nin the name of the Fund, and also claimed and received matching grants totalling \n$429,500 from the Ministry of Education (MOE), although the donations raised \ndid not fall within the purpose of the Fund and would not qualify as donations to \n \nthe Fund": 36, "After the event, NYP obtained the endorsement of the Fund\u2019s Management \nCommittee to include the purpose (for which the donations were solicited) in the \nFund but did not seek approval from MOE although MOE\u2019s approval was required \nunder the legislation governing IPCs": 36, "Following AGO\u2019s enquiry, NYP sought MOE\u2019s approval in September 2015, \nalmost a year after the event": 37, "Instead of taking actions to remedy the situation, NYP left it \nto one of the event organisers to appeal to MOE on the use of the donations and to \nfollow up with the donors should the appeal be unsuccessful": 37, "Throughout the process, \nNYP did not inform MOE that the donations had already been raised and received \nby NYP and that it had issued tax deduction receipts and claimed matching grants \nfor these donations": 37, "As at April 2016, the donations were held by NYP pending the \noutcome of the event organiser\u2019s appeal to MOE": 37, "The legislation requires entities managing IPCs to \nadhere to specific rules and controls, and IPCs themselves to meet the standards of \nregulatory compliance and governance": 37, "Following the audit, NYP indicated that it has since informed MOE of the \nirregularity and is currently working with MOE and the event organiser on the \nappropriate remedial actions": 37, "The \nlapses included adopting an inappropriate basis to determine rental, not accurately \nreflecting NYP\u2019s requirements in tender specifications, and not obtaining requisite \nconsent from the operator and approval from NYP\u2019s approving authority before \nimplementing contract variations": 37, "As a result, the key revenue contracting principles \nof open and fair competition, transparency and securing fair total returns were not \nupheld": 37, "NYP called an open tender in 2010 to appoint an operator for a childcare \ncentre on its premises for a period of three years with an option to renew for \n \nthree years and thereafter another three years": 38, "When NYP called the open tender, it did not comply with Government\u2019s \ninstructions to determine the rental for the premises through market tests or \nprofessional valuers": 38, "Instead, it had fixed the rental based on the rental rates of two \nchildcare centres in other locations without assessing whether these rental rates were \nreflective of the prevailing market rate": 38, "When the tenancy was extended for another three years on 1 December 2013, \nNYP continued to charge the same rental rate on the basis that the rate was reasonable \nwhen compared to those charged by the other four polytechnics for the childcare \ncentres on their premises": 38, "In addition, \nNYP did not comply with Government\u2019s instructions which require that rental rate \nfor tenancy renewal be determined either by professional valuers or based on prices \nof recently leased out premises in close proximity": 38, "Based on the market rental of \nchildcare centres located at nearby Housing and Development Board properties, AGO \nestimated that the rental forgone for the three-year period from 1 December 2013 to \n30 November 2016 amounted to $443,200": 38, "NYP informed AGO that it would take measures to ensure compliance with \nGovernment\u2019s instructions and

initial period of three years with an option to renew for \nthree years and thereafter another three years": 39, "NYP did not use an appropriate basis to determine the market rental \nfor the premises and predetermined the monthly rental of $1,650 \nbefore the tender was called": 39, "NYP justified the predetermined rental \nrate on the basis that it was comparable to the rates used by other \npolytechnics and existing canteens in NYP": 39, "In addition, using the rates of NYP\u2019s existing \ncanteens as a benchmark was not appropriate as these rates were \nalso predetermined by NYP and were not market rates": 39, "This predetermined rental was based on the total \nfloor area for the stalls (a smaller area within the canteen)": 39, "Based on \nNYP\u2019s requirement (as shown in its internal paper), the rental would \nbe revised if there were changes in total floor area occupied by the \nstalls": 39, "In \naddition, the specifications wrongly reflected that the tenancy would \ncommence upon tender award, even though the requirement was for \nthe tenancy to commence upon the handing over of premises to the \noperator": 39, "The unclear tender specifications would lead to tenderers \nnot having complete and accurate information to formulate their bids, \nwhich might result in them submitting sub-optimal bids": 39, "After the contract had been awarded, there were contract variations \non rental and stall floor area which were not properly administered": 40, "NYP told the operator to proceed with renovation that would increase \nthe total stall floor area, without first informing the operator of \nand obtaining its consent for the resultant higher monthly rental of \n$2,200": 40, "The requisite approval from NYP\u2019s approving authority was also not \nobtained before the contract variations were effected": 40, "Not obtaining \nprior approval undermines the role of the approving authority and \nbypasses the controls put in place to ensure that all contract variations \nare properly justified before they are implemented": 40, "NYP informed AGO that it has since changed the tendering process for its \ncanteen premises to one that invites tenderers to submit their rental bids, taking \ninto consideration NYP\u2019s requirement of keeping food and drink prices low": 40, "NYP \nwould also ensure that its officers involved in tender

that the successful vendor had not met \nthe required financial category which IPOS had set as a qualifying criterion for the \ntender": 42, "The acceptance of bids that did not meet mandatory

of all \nGovernment ministries and organs of state)": 1, "2\nOverview\nAs AGO\u2019s audits are conducted on a test check basis, they do not reveal all \nirregularities and weaknesses": 2, "These are typically the more significant findings in terms of monetary value, frequency \nof occurrence and impact on accounting": 2, "Minor lapses are also reported if they point \nto significant or systemic weaknesses in internal controls which, if not addressed, \ncould lead to serious consequences": 2, "The reporting of audit observations in the Report of the Auditor-General is an essential \npart of the system of public accountability": 2, "The irregularities and weaknesses \nreported do not necessarily reflect the general state of administration in the entities \naudited, but point to the areas where improvement should be made in the accounting, \nmanagement and use of public funds and resources": 2, "This Report is submitted to the President giving an account of all the audits conducted \nin the financial year": 2, "It would subsequently be presented to Parliament and deliberated \non by the Public Accounts Committee": 2, "In this Overview, I would like to highlight the following five areas where public sector \nentities could pay greater attention to and improve on their internal control systems": 2, "3\nOverview\nMonitoring of Performance of Contractors\nThis year, several audit findings pertain to the inadequate monitoring of performance \nof contractors": 3, "There were a number of instances where public sector entities were \nfound to be lax in ensuring that contractors comply with contract requirements": 3, "AGO\u2019s site inspections revealed many instances of works not performed in accordance \nwith contract requirements": 3, "Despite the failures by contractors in complying with \ncontract requirements, the public sector entities had certified that services were \nsatisfactorily rendered and payments were made to the contractors": 3, "I note that in \none case, an entity had extended a contract for outsourced works despite repeated \nnon-compliance with contract requirements by the contractor": 3, "Inadequate monitoring of performance of contractors could result in public sector \nentities not obtaining full value for the public funds spent": 3, "The entities should hold \ncontractors accountable for compliance with contract requirements, including taking \nfirm action against errant contractors, where warranted": 3, "Oversight of Projects Managed by External Consultants\nAGO\u2019s test checks on two projects managed by external consultants revealed laxity \nin oversight and monitoring of the work of the external consultants by public sector \nentities": 3, "In the first case, AGO found that the consultant had not complied with \nGovernment procurement rules when procuring items for the project on behalf of \nthe public sector entity": 3, "Hence, there was no assurance of open and fair competition, \nand value for money for the items purchased": 3, "In the other case, AGO observed that \nthe consultant had not been diligent in checking the claims submitted by contractors": 3, "It is important for public sector entities to exercise proper oversight over \nexternal consultants appointed to manage projects funded through public funds": 3, "This is to ensure that the use of public funds and the outcomes of the projects meet \nGovernment\u2019s objectives": 3, "4\nOverview\nProcurement\nBased on the audits for this year and the last six years, AGO observed that procurement \nhas continued to be an area prone to lapses": 4, "While efforts had been made to enhance \nprocurement rules and procedures across the public sector over the last few years, \nthere were indications that some entities were not sufficiently diligent in ensuring \ncompliance with procurement rules in the areas that AGO audited": 4, "AGO observed \ninstances of non-compliance with Government procurement rules and principles \nof transparency, open and fair competition, and value for money": 4, "comparisons of bids not carried out on \na like-for-like basis, and accepting tenders not meeting tender specifications/\nevaluation criteria)": 4, "AGO also observed irregularities in the manner in which two public sector entities \nhad awarded contracts to related parties": 4, "For example, an entity had awarded \ntwo tenders to a related party (its subsidiary) even though the bids submitted by the \nrelated party did not comply with tender specifications": 4, "Without open and fair competition, there is no assurance that public sector \nentities are able to secure competitive prices for the goods and services procured": 4, "The entities\u2019 actions could also lead to the perception that the related parties were \ngiven preferential treatment or unfair advantage over other vendors": 4, "As public funds \nare involved in such dealings, public sector entities should ensure that transactions \nwith related parties are at arm\u2019s length and be seen to be so": 4, "5\nOverview\nManagement of Stocks and Stores\nAGO found a few instances of poor management of stocks and stores": 5, "For example, \nsurprise checks were not carried out on stocks as required and stocks/stores were not \naccounted for": 5, "There was also no prompt follow-up on overdue loans of stores and \nno proper monitoring system to ensure that items were purchased only when needed": 5, "To minimise the risk of wastage, misuse and pilferage, it is important for public sector \nentities to put in place effective monitoring systems for stocks and stores": 5, "Management of Computer Access Controls\nAGO also observed a number of instances where public sector entities had not been \nvigilant in their management of computer access controls": 5, "Not removing accounts of users who were no longer performing functions \nwhich required access to the IT systems": 5, "It is of concern that despite the reporting of lapses in computer access controls found \nin various entities in previous Reports of the Auditor-General, AGO found similar \nlapses in other entities audited this year": 5, "Weak controls over access rights could \ncompromise the integrity and confidentiality of data stored in IT systems": 5, "Public \nsector entities cannot afford to be lax given that many of the entities\u2019 operations are \nhighly computerised": 5, "6\nOverview\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to put on record my recognition of the continued co-operation given \nto AGO by the ministries, organs of state, statutory boards, Government-owned \ncompanies and other entities audited": 6, "I would also like to express my thanks to all my officers for maintaining high \nprofessional standards

30, "Instead, MCI obtained approval from an officer \nwho can only approve contract variations which did not involve increase in APV": 30, "MCI explained that part of the increase in APV was due to

agencies can continue to enjoy competitive prices in the long run": 31, "MCI said that the higher proportion of awards to certain vendors reflected \nthe public sector agencies\u2019 assessment that those vendors presented the best value \nproposition for their needs": 31, "The high consumption of services from certain vendors \nalso corresponded with the positive feedback from the public sector agencies on \nthe ability of those vendors to perform and deliver the required services": 31, "MCI did \nnot observe any irregularities or wrongdoings based on the feedback from public \nsector agencies": 31, "MOF\u2019s \nview is that the inclusion of multiple vendors in demand aggregation contracts is to \ncater to the wide variety of needs that public sector agencies may have": 32, "If the high \nconcentration of awards to a particular vendor on the panel is a result of the vendor \nbeing able to provide goods/services at a suitable pricing that best meet public sector \nagencies\u2019 needs, this is not a negative outcome": 32, "Nonetheless, MCI agreed that it was important to have a good spread of \nbusiness opportunities in the creative services industry and to build up experience \nand expertise of more industry players in government communications": 32, "MCI said \nthat it had facilitated this by sharing all vendors\u2019 information, such as their portfolios \nand contacts, with public sector agencies": 32, "MCI had also included a Pitching Fee \nline item in the WOG PCFA, which provided for a public sector agency to invite \none or more vendors to pitch their proposals for the agency\u2019s project, if desired": 32, "That enabled public sector agencies to try out different vendors and assess who is \nmost suitable for their project":

to the Permanent \nSecretaries of their respective supervising ministries": 2, "These are typically \nobservations which indicate malfeasance, lapses with significant financial impact, \nsystemic or common lapses that may seriously weaken financial governance and \ncontrols if not corrected, or serve as useful learning points for improvements across \nthe Whole-of-Government": 2, "This Report is submitted to the President who shall, in accordance with section 3(3) \nof the Audit Act, present it to Parliament": 2, "The Public Accounts Committee deliberates \non the Report and may call upon public sector entities to account for lapses, where \nit deems necessary": 2, "3\nOverview\nThe reporting of audit observations in the Report of the Auditor-General is an essential \npart of the system of public accountability": 3, "The Government Financial Statements (incorporating the accounts of all 16 \nGovernment ministries and 8 organs of state)\n\u2022\t\n1 Government fund\n\u2022\t\n13 statutory boards\n\u2022\t\n4 Government-owned companies\n\u2022\t\n3 other accounts\nFinancial Statements Audits\nFor the financial year 2019/20, I have issued an unmodified audit opinion on the \nGovernment Financial Statements": 3, "I have also audited and issued unmodified audit \nopinions on the financial statements of three statutory boards, a Government fund, \nfour Government-owned companies and three other accounts": 3, "Selective Audits\nAGO carried out selective audits of eight statutory boards whose financial statements \nwere not audited by AGO": 3, "Thematic Audit\nAGO conducted a thematic audit on selected business grant programmes managed by \nthe Workforce Singapore Agency (WSG) and the Enterprise Singapore Board (ESG)": 3, "In addition to the above audits, AGO carried out checks on Government ministries, \norgans of state and statutory boards arising from matters that come to AGO\u2019s attention \nthrough complaints, feedback or observations from past audits": 3, "4\nOverview\nSummary of Audit Observations\nAGO\u2019s audit observations for the financial year 2019/20 are mainly in the areas \nof Information Technology (IT) controls, procurement and contract management, \noperations management, and management of business grants": 4, "The audit observations \nhave been conveyed to the public sector entities concerned through AGO Management \nLetters for their follow-up": 4, "The more significant audit observations relating to 3 out \nof 16 Government ministries and 8 out of 13 statutory boards audited are highlighted \nin this Report": 4, "Weaknesses in IT controls\n\u2022 \nLapses in procurement and contract management\n\u2022 \nLapses in operations management\n\u2022 \nGaps in management of business grant programmes\n(1)\t\nWeaknesses in IT Controls\nAGO noted weaknesses in IT controls and Information and Communication \nTechnology (ICT) governance in its audits of the following public sector entities: \nthe Ministry of Finance (Accountant-General\u2019s Department), the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice (Public Service Division), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the Ngee Ann \nPolytechnic (NP), the Republic Polytechnic (RP), the Public Utilities Board (PUB), \nWSG and ESG": 4, "Some of the weaknesses in IT controls noted were over the most privileged operating \nsystem (OS) user accounts and privileged user activities": 4, "The most privileged OS \naccount is a powerful account which gives the user full access privileges to the \noperating system, including the ability to make changes to the activity logs, user \naccess and OS security settings": 4, "It is therefore generally considered a best practice \nto restrict access to the most privileged OS account and to monitor and review all \nactivities carried out using this account": 4, "AGO also noted technical misconfigurations \nof the security software in application and database (DB) servers in a few entities": 4, "The \nmisconfigurations led to OS administrators being able to access the most privileged \nOS accounts and other privileged OS accounts, without password authentication": 4, "5\nOverview\nAGO further noted that some entities did not conduct adequate reviews of activities \ncarried out using privileged accounts": 5, "For NP, AGO noted that there was inadequate \nreview of the critical DB activities carried out using the privileged DB user accounts": 5, "This was because it did not configure its Security Information and Event Management \nsystem to flag out certain critical actions for review": 5, "For a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project under PUB, AGO noted that PUB \ndid not ensure that its private sector partner had implemented adequate controls on \nusers\u2019 access to the latter\u2019s IT system": 5, "The control lapses included: excessive rights \ngranted to the partner\u2019s vendor, sharing of an administrator account among staff of \nthe partner and its vendor staff, no separate accounts for users with both privileged \nand non-privileged roles and no automatic time-out implemented for user accounts": 5, "For MFA, AGO noted that its overall ICT governance ought to be strengthened, \nparticularly in the conduct of planned ICT audits and annual self-assessment": 5, "For RP, AGO noted that it did not implement security measures to safeguard the \nintegrity of its electronic payment batch files, resulting in the risk of unauthorised \nchanges being made to the payment files": 5, "(2)\t\nLapses in Procurement and Contract Management\nAGO found lapses in procurement and contract management at the Government \nTechnology Agency, the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), the National Library \nBoard (NLB) and PUB": 5, "In some cases, \napprovals were sought after works had commenced or after works had already \nbeen completed": 6, "\u2022 \nNo approvals sought for substantial increase in variation costs over earlier \napproved variation costs": 6, "For NLB in particular, AGO noted that its management of contract variations and \noverall project management for the revamp of the National Archives of Singapore \nbuilding was weak": 6, "In-principle approvals (IPAs) were sought for variations without \ncompelling reasons, and IPA requests were approved even though no ballpark cost \nestimates were provided": 6, "Public officers who are appointed as approving \nauthorities for procurement and contracts should take their role seriously": 6, "They should \nscrutinise requests, raise questions and exercise due diligence as approving authorities": 6, "For JTC, AGO observed that it had made a payment to a terminated contractor \neven though under the contract, it could have withheld the payment and used it \nto offset against the debt claimable from the contractor": 6, "JTC subsequently filed a \nclaim against the terminated contractor for the debt claimable under the contract": 6, "In the audit of an overseas mission, AGO noted that there were inadequate measures \nto enforce terms stipulated in the service agreements signed with its Authorised Visa \nAgents (AVAs)": 6, "The service agreements stipulated a fixed visa application fee and \nrequired AVAs to only use designated credit cards when transmitting visa processing \nfees to MFA": 6, "However, AGO found that visa application fees stated on the websites \nof three AVAs were higher than the fixed fee stipulated in the service agreements": 6, "In addition, the controls in the ICT system were not effective in detecting the use of \nnon-designated credit cards by AVAs to transmit visa processing fees": 6, "7\nOverview\nIn the audit of JTC, AGO noted that its leased and tenanted premises may have been \nsublet to about 26,000 entities without its approval": 7, "In addition, \nduring site visits, AGO noted instances of illegal storage and/or sale of diesel to the \npublic at four of its leased industrial premises": 7, "In the audit of PUB, AGO observed weaknesses in controls over payments made \nunder a PPP arrangement": 7, "The private sector partner was able to modify real-time \nvalues of parameters in its IT system, which would affect the amounts to be paid by \nPUB": 7, "Furthermore, PUB had largely relied on information provided by the partner \nto make payments without carrying out adequate independent verification": 7, "(4)\t\nGaps in Management of Business Grant Programmes\nAGO carried out a thematic audit covering six selected business grant programmes \nmanaged by WSG and ESG (three each for WSG and ESG)": 7, "40 million \nwas disbursed under these six selected business grant programmes for the period \n1 April 2018 to 30 June 2019": 7, "Of these, AGO test-checked 285 disbursements made \nby WSG and ESG to programme partners (PPs) and directly to grant recipients, \ntotalling $100": 7, "Grant Design and Setup\nWSG and ESG had generally put in place policies and procedures to manage the \nselected grant programmes": 7, "By and large, the grant programmes had defined \nobjectives and deliverables which were approved by the correct authority": 7, "8\nOverview\nGrant Evaluation and Approval\nBoth WSG and ESG had established criteria and guidelines for the evaluation of grant \napplications": 8, "For WSG, there were inconsistent practices \nacross PPs in their stipulation of requirements to grant recipients and their checks \nperformed on grant applications": 8, "AGO also noted three cases where companies or \nindividuals might have circumvented grant requirements and controls put in place": 8, "For ESG, the administration of \ngrants was decentralised to its officers in the various ESG clusters": 8, "However, there \nwere inconsistent practices across the different officers when assessing companies\u2019 \neligibility": 8, "There was also inadequate assurance that deviations from policy guidelines \nwere monitored and approved": 8, "Grant Disbursement\nWSG and ESG had put in place processes and guidelines for checking and approving \ngrant claims, including having different levels of approving authorities based on grant \namount": 8, "For WSG, \nAGO found instances of double claims by companies and cases of double funding \nacross different grants": 58, "For ESG, AGO noted cases where the grants disbursed were \nnot in line with grant guidelines, resulting in excess or shortfall in disbursements": 8, "Grant Monitoring and Review\nBoth WSG and ESG entered into agreements with grant recipients or PPs for approved \ngrants, stipulating the deliverables and outcomes to be monitored": 8, "Grant recipients and \nPPs were required to submit reports and documents to show progress or achievement of \nmilestones/deliverables": 8, "For WSG, \nthere was a need to strengthen monitoring of the programme outcomes for one of the \ngrant programmes while for ESG, it could improve its oversight of PPs with regard to \ndisbursements made to participating companies of overseas trade fairs and missions": 8, "9\nOverview\nGrant Cessation\nBoth WSG and ESG had put in place standard operating procedures setting out \nthe process for closure of agreements and the timeline for refund of any unutilised \ngrants": 9, "However, there were instances where WSG did not follow up with the PPs \nto recover unutilised grants in a timely manner for programmes which had ended": 9, "While ESG had a process in place to identify lapsed projects, the monitoring of its \nofficers\u2019 follow-up actions was inadequate": 9, "Falsification of Receipts and Possible Irregularities Noted in Quotations\nAGO found weaknesses in controls over the cash collection process at JTC, such as no \nsegregation of duties in receiving and recording of cash received, and no reconciliation \nof cash collected with the hardcopy receipts issued": 9, "In addition, five of the receipts \nprovided to AGO contained signs which cast doubt on their authenticity": 9, "AGO also found possible irregularities in three quotations submitted by a JTC \ncontractor for a star rate item1, and had concerns over the authenticity of all three \nquotations": 9, "Concluding Remarks\nAGO\u2019s audits serve to enhance public accountability and help strengthen the financial \ngovernance of public sector entities": 9, "This report highlights the more significant \nobservations from AGO\u2019s audits carried out for the financial year 2019/20": 9, "In the area of IT controls, public sector entities should give greater attention to the \nmanagement of the most privileged OS user account and other privileged OS and DB \nuser accounts": 9, "This is important as these accounts are not only assigned to officers \nfrom public sector entities but also to IT vendor staff": 9, "Public sector entities should therefore ensure that the \nsecurity software governing access of these accounts is properly configured and \nrestrict the use of these accounts to users on a strict job-needs basis": 9, "10\nOverview\nIn the area of procurement and contract management, public officers entrusted \nwith responsibilities as approving authorities, e": 10, "They should go \nthrough evaluation reports and proposals thoroughly, raise questions when proposals \nare not clear or justifications are not compelling, or when key information on costs \nand cost reasonableness is not included": 10, "Approving authorities play an important \nrole in ensuring that Government procurement principles of transparency, open and \nfair competition, and value for money are upheld": 10, "There is also a need for basic \nstaff work to be improved such as providing reasons when proposing changes or \nvariations, seeking approval prior to making financial commitments and documenting \nreasons for key decisions": 10, "I am pleased to note that the public sector entities audited by AGO take the audit \nobservations seriously and are committed to taking concrete steps to rectify the lapses \nand weaknesses": 10, "Acknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge the co-operation given to AGO by the Government \nministries, organs of state, statutory boards, Government-owned companies and \nother entities audited": 10, "I would also like to express my appreciation to all my officers for maintaining \nhigh professional standards and showing dedication and commitment in enhancing \npublic accountability": 10, "PART  I\n(A)\nAUDIT  OF  GOVERNMENT  FINANCIAL  \nSTATEMENTS\n(B)\nAUDIT  OF  GOVERNMENT  MINISTRIES,  \nORGANS  OF  STATE  AND

PaC@Gov system \nto administer and effect payments relating to payroll and claims (such as transport \nand medical claims) to civil servants": 14, "AGO\u2019s test checks of two PaC@Gov application servers found that the \ncontrols over the most privileged operating system (OS) user account were weak": 14, "All six OS administrators, who were AGD\u2019s IT vendor staff, were able \nto, and had logged into the most privileged OS user account without \npassword authentication": 14, "AGD\u2019s log review process was not robust, resulting in AGD being \nunable to detect that there was unauthorised use of the most privileged \nOS user account": 14, "The most privileged OS user account has full access privileges to make \nchanges to the OS audit logs, OS user access, interface files (such as files containing \ndata on bonuses and allowances uploaded onto the system) and OS security settings": 15, "Any unauthorised activity carried out using the most privileged OS user account \ncould compromise the PaC@Gov application servers and could affect the processing \nof bonuses and allowances in the PaC@Gov system": 15, "At the time of AGO\u2019s audit in February 2020, six of AGD\u2019s IT vendor staff \nperformed the role of the OS administrator": 15, "According to AGD, it had requested \nits IT vendor to control the OS administrators\u2019 access to the most privileged OS user \naccount with a password and the OS administrator could only obtain the password \nafter seeking approval from a designated AGD officer before each use": 15, "However, AGO found that the two application servers were misconfigured \nby AGD\u2019s IT vendor such that after the OS administrators had logged into the \nserver using their individual non-privileged OS user account and password, \nthey could gain access to the most privileged OS user account without having to \nkey in any password": 15, "AGO\u2019s review of logs on activities carried out during the \nperiod 1 April 2019 to 11 February 2020 found 111 instances where the six OS \nadministrators had gained access to the most privileged OS user account without \npassword authentication to perform activities on the two application servers": 15, "The OS administrators did not seek AGD\u2019s approval for each use as the system \ndid not prompt for a password upon log-in to the account": 15, "The lack of password \nauthentication to access the most privileged OS user account increased the risk of \nunauthorised access and consequently, unauthorised activities carried out using \nthis account": 15, "AGD had a log review process that required its IT vendor to carry out a \nfirst-level review of the logs on activities carried out by the OS administrators and \nto highlight anomalies for AGD\u2019s second-level review and follow-up": 16, "However, AGO \nfound that the first-level review, which was carried out by an independent team within \nthe IT vendor\u2019s organisation, did not check whether the use of the most privileged \nOS user account was authorised by AGD": 16, "The first-level review also did not check \nwhether activities performed should have been carried out using the privileged OS \nuser account": 16, "As a result, while the 111 instances where the OS administrators had \nused the most privileged OS user account were captured in the logs and noted during \nthe first-level review by the IT vendor staff, those instances were not highlighted to \nAGD for its second-level review and follow-up": 16, "Consequently, any unauthorised or \nimproper use of the most privileged OS user account would not be detected by AGD": 16, "AGD informed AGO that it had performed full remediation and follow-up \nactions to ensure that the integrity of the PaC@Gov system and the Government \npayroll processing had not been compromised": 16, "Fully rectified the technical misconfiguration of the two application \nservers to ensure that access to the most privileged OS user

OS accounts, which \nwere not meant to be used by them, without password authentication": 18, "No Restriction on Use of Most Privileged OS Account by OS Administrators \nto Carry Out Daily Activities\n18": 18, "Two of the six OS administrators had been using the most privileged OS \naccount to carry out daily activities in the two main HRMS database servers": 18, "AGO \nalso noted that PSD did not review all the activities carried out using the most \nprivileged OS account during its monthly review of logs": 18, "According to PSD, the \ntwo OS administrators had been using the

changes to the audit log capturing \nthe activities of OS administrators, changes to user access rights and OS security \nsettings": 18, "Hence, it is generally considered a best practice to restrict access to the most \nprivileged OS account and monitor and review all activities relating to this account": 18, "Software Wrongly Configured Allowing Unauthorised IT Staff to Access \nPrivileged Accounts Without Password Authentication\n20": 18, "AGO also observed that another two of the six OS administrators could log into \ntwo other privileged OS accounts without keying in any password in HRMS": 18, "AGO \nfound that a security software which was used to control access to privileged accounts \nin HRMS had been wrongly configured to allow these two OS administrators to access \nthe two privileged accounts without password authentication": 18, "According to PSD, these \ntwo OS administrators should not have had access to the two privileged accounts": 18, "The weak controls over access to privileged OS accounts increased the risks \nof unauthorised activities in the operating system and the database not being detected": 19, "Such unauthorised activities might result in HRMS not being able to store or retrieve \ndata in its database": 19, "Users (both HR users and end-users) might not be able to access \ndata in HRMS to perform HR-related activities such as creating personnel records, \ngenerating staff curriculum vitae and applying for leave": 19, "Going forward, it would ensure that access to the most privileged \nOS account would be granted strictly on a needs basis": 19, "It would also \nmonitor and review all activities performed using the most privileged \nOS account on a monthly basis": 19, "It had completed the analysis of system logs for 14 months and \nconfirmed that the two OS administrators had not logged on to the \ntwo other privileged accounts during the period analysed": 19, "It had reviewed and rectified the configuration of the security

Agents\n23": 19, "AGO\u2019s audit of an overseas mission (OM) found that there were inadequate \nmeasures put in place to enforce terms stipulated in the service agreements signed \nwith its Authorised Visa Agents (AVAs)": 19, "AVAs are companies appointed by OMs to \nprocess visa applications and collect visa processing fees on their behalf": 19, "Amongst \nother things, the service agreements stipulated a fixed visa application fee (comprising \na fixed visa processing fee to be paid to the Singapore Government and a fixed service \nfee to be retained by the AVA) and required the AVAs to use designated credit cards \nwhen transmitting the visa processing fees to the Singapore Government": 19, "The visa application fees stated on the websites of three AVAs (out \nof the

monitor and \nenforce the terms stated in the service agreements": 20, "Practices of over-charging, if left \nunchecked, could affect the Government\u2019s reputation as visa applicants may assume \nthat the Government condoned such practices": 20, "The three AVAs explained to MFA that the websites checked by AGO were \nnot their official websites but websites created by either a department or staff from \ntheir company without the company\u2019s approval": 20, "As part of these checks, the OMs would ensure \nthat visa application fees are prominently displayed in the AVAs\u2019 offices and

Auditor-General\u2019s \nOffice (AGO) for the financial year 2010/11": 1, "The audits were conducted pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore \n(1999 Revised Edition), the Audit Act (Cap": 1, "Conduct of Audits\nAGO\u2019s audits are broadly categorised into financial statements audits and selective \naudits1": 1, "The audits help give assurance to the President, Parliament and the public \non the proper accounting, management and use of public funds and resources": 1, "This \nstrengthens the accountability of public sector bodies as custodians and stewards of \npublic funds and resources": 1, "With regard to financial statements audits, AGO audits the Government Financial \nStatements every year": 1, "where AGO is not the auditor of the financial statements of a \nstatutory board, the board would appoint a commercial auditor in consultation with \nthe Auditor-General": 1, "As for selective audits, these are carried out on statutory boards and Government \nfunds in rotation": 1, "AGO\u2019s audits are carried out on a test check basis and therefore would not reveal all \nirregularities": 1, "Audit findings are conveyed to the Government ministries, statutory boards and other \nentities audited by way of \u201cmanagement letters\u201d": 1, "In the case of statutory boards, the \nmanagement letters are also sent to their supervising ministries": 1, "1\u2002 A selective audit involves checking for financial regularity and ascertaining whether there has been \nexcess, extravagance, or gross inefficiency tantamount to waste and whether measures to prevent \nthem are in place": 1, "2\nReport of the Auditor-General \nThe Report of the Auditor-General is submitted to the President and presented to \nParliament": 2, "The Public Accounts Committee deliberates on the Report and, where \nnecessary, requires the Government ministries and statutory boards concerned to \naccount for the irregularities reported": 2, "The audit findings in the Report are generally the more significant ones in terms of \nmonetary value, frequency of occurrence or impact on accounting": 2, "Smaller lapses \nare also reported where they point to significant or systemic weaknesses in internal \ncontrol": 2, "Audits for Financial Year 2010/11\nFor the financial year 2010/11, AGO audited the Government Financial Statements \n(comprising the accounts of all Government ministries and organs of state), four \nGovernment funds and 10 statutory boards": 2, "AGO also investigated 13 complaints \non matters relating to the management and use of public funds and resources": 2, "During the year, AGO also audited the financial statements of five Government-owned \ncompanies and five other accounts": 2, "Part I of this Report is on the audit of the Government Financial Statements and on \nselected observations from the audit of Government ministries, organs of state and \nGovernment funds": 2, "Part III covers the audit of the financial statements of Government-owned companies \nand other accounts": 2, "3\nHighlights of Audit Observations\nThis year, many of the lapses found in the audits of Government ministries and \nstatutory boards are in procurement": 3, "They arose when the Government procurement \nrules and principles of transparency, and open and fair competition were not \nadhered to": 3, "Examples are waiving competition based on weak grounds, setting an \nunrealistically short period for submission of bids thereby limiting competition, not \ngiving equal opportunity to tenderers to revise their bid price when requirements \nwere changed, and accepting a tender which did not meet tender specifications": 3, "It \nis important that officers not only observe procurement rules, but also uphold the \nprinciples underlying public sector procurement": 3, "AGO found instances of inaccurate or incomplete information \nprovided to tender approving authorities for their decision on acceptance of a \ntender": 3, "In the last few years, AGO has reported a number of such cases including \none where a purchase commitment was made even before approval of the tender \napproving authority was sought to accept the tender": 3, "Public officers must exercise \ndue diligence to ensure that accurate and complete information pertaining to tenders \nis provided to a tender approving authority": 3, "In the last four years, I have reported lapses in projects involving external parties \nappointed as project managers or consultants": 3, "This year\u2019s audits found two projects \nmanaged by an external party where lapses were pervasive resulting in a Government \ndepartment being grossly overcharged and making large payments for materials \nbefore delivery": 3, "It cannot be over-emphasised that public agencies must not \nover-rely on external parties, acting on their behalf, to comply with Government \ncontrol procedures on procurement and payment": 3, "They may not share the same values \nand instincts expected of public officers, with regard to financial prudence": 3, "Public \nagencies should be circumspect when reviewing the work or recommendations of \nexternal parties": 3, "I note that the lapses found were largely due to administrative expediency taking \nprecedence over financial prudence": 3, "The agencies concerned can do more to ensure \nadequate financial vigilance in their procurement and payment practices": 3, "4\nGood Governance Guides for Statutory Boards\nIn my Report last year, I mentioned that AGO had presented two guides, namely \n\u201cGood Governance Principles for Statutory Boards\u201d and \u201cImplementation Guidelines \non Internal Auditing in Statutory Boards\u201d, to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), with a \nrecommendation that they be considered for adoption by statutory boards": 4, "MOF has since circulated the two guides to statutory boards which they can refer to \nand adopt taking into consideration their needs and circumstances": 4, "Amending the Audit Act\nIn 2009, AGO submitted a report to the Prime Minister with recommendations for \nenhancing the effectiveness of AGO\u2019s audits of statutory boards": 4, "In the report, AGO \nrecommended placing the mandate to audit statutory boards under one umbrella \nlegislation, i": 4, "The Prime Minister\u2019s Office has since agreed that \nthe Auditor-General should have the legal mandate to audit all statutory boards and \nto have this provision included in the Audit Act": 4, "Enhancing Audit Coverage\nFor statutory boards, since the financial year 2007/08, AGO has been conducting \nmainly selective audits2 while their financial statements are audited by commercial \nauditors appointed in consultation with the Auditor-General": 4, "As the focus of a \nselective audit is on checking for financial regularity and ascertaining whether there \nhas been excess, extravagance or gross inefficiency in the management and use of \npublic funds and resources, this approach also enables AGO to contribute more to \nimproving public sector processes and practices in the management and use of public \nfunds and resources": 4, "2\u2002 The authority for selective audits of statutory boards is provided for under an MOF circular, read \nwith section 4(4) of the Audit Act": 4, "5\nAs for Government ministries and departments, AGO\u2019s audits are focused on checks \nto enable AGO to render an opinion on the Government Financial Statements": 5, "A \nselective audit is carried out only as and when there are indications, usually arising \nfrom the audit of the Government Financial Statements or public complaints, that \na specific area requires closer audit scrutiny": 5, "AGO\u2019s recent audits have shown that \nGovernment departments are no less vulnerable to lapses than statutory boards in the \nmanagement and use of public funds and resources": 5, "As Government departments \nshould not be different from statutory boards insofar as accountability in the \nmanagement and use of public funds and resources is concerned, I intend to schedule \nGovernment departments for selective audits in rotation, just like for statutory boards, \nif resources permit": 5, "In 2011, the Public Accounts Committee recommended that statutory boards be \naudited by AGO at least once every five years": 5, "The current audit frequency of at \nleast once every seven years is enabled by the increased staffing level approved in \n2008": 5, "AGO will carry out a review to determine the additional resources required to \nimplement the Committee\u2019s 2011 recommendation as well as to carry out selective \naudits of Government departments on a rotation basis": 5, "Acknowledgements\nI acknowledge with thanks the co-operation given to my audit teams by Government \nministries, organs of state, statutory boards and other entities audited": 5, "PART  I\n(A) \nAUDIT  OF  GOVERNMENT  FINANCIAL  \nSTATEMENTS\n(B)\nAUDIT  OF

Statements (GFS), \nAGO carries out test checks of internal controls of selected areas in Government \nministries and organs of state": 6, "As and when a test check points to irregularities or \nwhen certain matters of concern come to AGO\u2019s attention, for example, through a \ncomplaint, AGO may carry out a separate audit into the specific area concerned": 6, "The enabling Acts of certain Government funds within the GFS require \nseparate accounts to be prepared and audited by the Auditor-General or another \nauditor": 6, "When the Auditor-General is not the auditor, the Minister concerned will \nappoint an auditor in consultation with the Auditor-General": 6, "In advising on the \nappointment, the Auditor-General would take into account the criteria listed in \nAppendix II":

would like to thank all the Government ministries, departments and \norgans of state for their co-operation in the audits": 6, "Selected observations arising from the audit of Government ministries, organs \nof state and Government funds are summarised in the paragraphs that follow": 6, "Under Government instructions, payments should be made only after goods \nare delivered or services satisfactorily rendered, unless advance payment is a normal \nindustry practice": 6, "The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) assigns development projects to the \nDefence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA)": 6, "At specified milestones, MINDEF \nmakes payment to DSTA based on the materials cost estimated at the time the projects \nare assigned": 6, "AGO observed instances where payments made to DSTA at specified \nmilestones far exceeded the actual materials cost incurred by DSTA": 6, "8 per cent of the total estimated materials cost \nbeing paid out by the fifth month of the 29-month-long project": 6, "MINDEF\u2019s payment to DSTA for materials cost long before it was incurred \nconstitutes advance payment which is unnecessary and goes against the Government \ninstructions": 10, "As at 31 March 2010, the cumulative advance payments made to DSTA for \nmaterials for various such projects were $333 million": 10, "Advance payments could have been \navoided if MINDEF\u2019s arrangement with DSTA had been to pay DSTA based on \nactual materials cost incurred at the project milestones, which were available at the \ntime of payment, instead of costs estimated at the time of

discrepancies were \nfound with regard to the quantity and identification of the assets (such as computers \nand printers)": 10, "AGO was not able to conclude whether the assets (involving materials \ncost of about $11 million) which MINDEF had paid for were received in good order": 10, "MINDEF informed AGO in May 2011 that it had since verified and reconciled \nthe assets handed over by DSTA with the delivery orders and other supporting \ndocuments": 10, "03 million in advances had not been recovered from 358 \nSingapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel who had left the service": 10, "MINDEF

"According to MINDEF, as at April 2011, almost half of the outstanding cases \nhad been recovered or written off": 10, "These include automating the debt recovery process, monthly \nreporting of outstanding debts and putting in place standard operating procedures": 10, "The Post-Secondary Education (PSE) Fund was established in January 2008 to \nhelp parents save for their children\u2019s post-secondary education": 10, "Moneys in the accounts can be withdrawn to pay fees and charges for certain \ncourses or programmes at approved institutions attended by the PSE account holders \nor

charges to be borne by the applicants and submit the withdrawal claims to the \nMinistry for processing": 10, "The Ministry would inform the PSE account holders of \nall transactions affecting their accounts through a monthly Statement of Account": 10, "AGO carried out test checks at selected institutions and observed at one \nprivate institution excess withdrawals from the Fund for payment of tuition fees \nand overseas study trips": 10, "The excess withdrawals arose from duplicate claims, and claims for \npayment of full tuition fees when these had already been partly or fully paid through \nscholarship/bursary awards or other means": 10, "The excess amounts withdrawn were not refunded to the PSE accounts but \nheld by the institution to pay the students\u2019 tuition fees for subsequent semesters": 10, "AGO \nnoted that as at 30 November 2010, the excess held per affected student ranged from \n$2 to $4,000, and five of the affected students had left the institution as far

reasonableness of rates used to price \ncontract variations (amounting to $1": 6, "Failure to properly assess contract \nvariations could result in MOE not obtaining full value for the public funds spent": 6, "(2)\t\nWeaknesses in IT Controls \nAs technology continues to play an important role in the delivery of public services to \ncitizens and businesses, there would be an increasing use of IT to automate processes \nand manage vast amounts of confidential data": 6, "While leveraging on IT to increase \nproductivity, it is critical that public sector entities put in place proper controls to \nprevent unauthorised access and safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of data \nin the IT systems": 6, "AGO found weaknesses in IT controls in its audits of the Accounting and Corporate

Financial Controls \nPublic sector entities are accountable for the management of public funds": 7, "They \nare responsible for putting in place adequate financial controls to ensure proper

lapses in revenue contracting in the Immigration \nand Checkpoints Authority (ICA)": 7, "8\nOverview\nFor PA, AGO\u2019s test checks on overseas purchases and payments amounting \n\nto $142,200 revealed serious weaknesses which could be exploited": 8, "AGO found that \nPA had allowed an officer to make overseas purchases and pay for them in cash or \nthrough a remittance agent, and to claim reimbursements from PA using cash sales \nreceipts": 8, "AGO noted that some of the cash sales receipts submitted had tell-tale \nsigns which cast doubts on their authenticity": 8, "Thus, there was no assurance that the \nreimbursements claimed were the same as the actual amounts of cash paid to the \noverseas vendors": 8, "AGO\u2019s test checks of welfare assistance schemes administered by nine Grassroots \nOrganisations (GROs) revealed that cash gifts and assistance in-kind, which included \nsupermarket vouchers and food vouchers given to needy residents, were not properly \nmanaged": 8, "Three GROs did not have documentary evidence of assessment on the \neligibility of recipients for assistance in-kind and cash gifts (totalling $128,100)": 8, "In addition, based on test checks of food vouchers totalling $762,400, it was found \nthat four GROs did not invalidate used food vouchers after they were submitted for \nreimbursement claims to prevent them from being re-submitted": 8, "Consequently, there \nwas no assurance that welfare assistance was given only to eligible applicants and \nthat vouchers were properly accounted for": 8, "AGO found that ICA had given the right to use its premises to operate photo booths \nto a recreation club without any competitive process and without charging any rental": 8, "ICA\u2019s direct allocation of premises to the club had deprived other potential operators \nof a fair chance to bid for the right to use the premises, and this had subjected \nICA to allegation of lack of transparency and mismanagement of Government \npremises": 8, "Not charging the club market rental was also contrary to Government\u2019s \ninstructions that Government premises be rented out at market rates": 8, "Under the Research and Innovation Enterprise \n2015 plan set up to boost research, innovation and enterprise, A*STAR and NRF are \ntwo of the key public sector entities responsible for managing R&D grant programmes": 8, "The five-year R&D grant budget (for the financial years 2011/12 to 2015/16) managed \nby A*STAR and NRF totalled $5": 8, "9\nOverview\nIn the thematic audit, AGO examined selected R&D grant programmes managed by \nA*STAR and

increased the efficiency of A*STAR\u2019s \ngrant management process": 9, "Nevertheless, in the course of audit, AGO noted some \ngaps in the processes and areas for improvement": 9, "AGO\u2019s test

the required quarterly \nreviews of accounts and associated access rights": 15, "Such regular reviews of accounts \nand access rights in the systems were needed to ensure that the accounts were valid

the user accounts had indeed been used by \nunauthorised persons to perform the procurement activities": 17, "For \nthe remaining 178 instances, MINDEF explained that the authorised users who were \non local leave might have gone back to office to perform the activities": 17, "Hence, the possibility that the accounts had been used by unauthorised persons to \nperform these activities could not be ruled out": 17, "With sharing of accounts, it would be difficult to pinpoint who had performed \na particular activity, and hence render it difficult to hold the person accountable for the

computed": 18, "The repeated failures to detect the \nerrors made by the contractor cast doubts on whether the FMA and DSTA had carried out \ntheir duties diligently": 18, "AGO\u2019s further checks revealed that DSTA would not check the accuracy of land \nareas declared by the contractor unless it was alerted by the FMA to disparities which \nthe FMA was unable to resolve with the contractor or when there were changes in land \nuse": 18, "For the six-year period from 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2017, DSTA did \nnot carry out any checks as it had never been alerted to such issues by the FMA and \nthere was no change in land use": 18, "Although the role of monitoring services rendered by the contractor had been \noutsourced to the FMA, DSTA was still responsible for proper contract management \nand payments": 18, "Hence, DSTA ought to provide proper oversight, including carrying \nout independent sample checks, to ensure that payments were in order": 18, "In addition, \nMINDEF, which paid for the services, remained accountable for the proper use of \nGovernment funds and hence should have measures in place to ensure that DSTA \nperformed its roles effectively": 18, "Following the audit observation, MINDEF informed AGO that DSTA and the \ncontractor had conducted an on-site verification to ascertain the grass-cutting areas, \nand found that the contractor had indeed overstated the areas in the past": 19, "DSTA would also impose contractual penalties on the contractor for over-claiming \nand on the FMA for failing to properly check the contractor\u2019s claims": 19, "In addition, \nMINDEF indicated that besides grass-cutting, the contractor also used area as the \nbasis for its charges for cleaning services and shrub trimming": 19, "Verification of areas \nused for computing such charges has been initiated and is expected to be completed \nby July 2018": 19, "MINDEF also stated that to prevent the recurrence of such overpayments, \nDSTA would put in place various enhancements to its contract management processes": 19, "These would include looking into adopting technological solutions to eliminate \nmanual computational errors and for more

which was determined through the open tender": 26, "When the right to use the premises was given to the club via direct allocation \ninstead of a competitive process, potential operators were deprived of a fair chance to bid \nfor that right": 27, "There was also no assurance that the club\u2019s offer was the best since potential \noperators might be able to put in better offers": 27, "Such unfair practices had subjected ICA to \nthe allegation of lack of transparency and mismanagement of Government premises": 27, "This \nwas worsened by the fact that the club was not charged any rental for using the premises, \nwhich was contrary to Government\u2019s instructions on revenue contracting that Government \npremises be rented out at market rates": 27, "Not charging the club market rental was equivalent \nto diverting moneys, which should have been collected by the Government as rental, to the \nclub": 27, "Its members were current or \nretired ICA staff and the club\u2019s moneys were used primarily to fund sports and recreational \nactivities for its members": 27, "For proper financial accountability and transparency, if ICA \ndeemed it necessary to provide funding to the club to

attention to these areas observed in some entities \nis of concern in view of the public sector\u2019s high dependency on IT systems and data \nfor Government operations, and the fast-evolving IT security threats": 4, "These include lapses such as \npayments not certified and contracts not signed by authorised officers, late payments \nto vendors and poor management of assets": 4, "Of particular \nconcern are the inadequate oversight of agents appointed to manage projects on behalf \nof public sector entities, and the management of contract variations": 4, "Such lapses \nwere found

National Parks Board (NParks) and the Ministry of Social and Family \nDevelopment (MSF)": 5, "The weaknesses include inadequate review of activities in \nIT systems, wrongful use of privileged accounts by officers or appointed vendors \nand lack of review of user access rights": 5, "In the audit of CPFB, AGO noted lapses in the management of the two IT security \nmonitoring systems which tracked the activities of CPFB\u2019s databases and systems": 5, "AGO \nfound that for a period of time, CPFB did not monitor the IT security monitoring \nsystems for unauthorised changes": 5, "For one IT security monitoring system, AGO\u2019s \ntest checks of the system logs for three months revealed that a significant percentage \n(about 88": 5, "7 per cent) of the changes made by the

5, "These lapses \ncould affect the effectiveness of the two IT security monitoring systems in detecting \nIT security violations": 5, "AGO also carried out checks on 15 user accounts assigned by CPFB to temporary \nstaff for two other IT systems and noted that system access of 14 user accounts was \nnot removed promptly after the staff had left CPFB": 5, "Six of these accounts were used \nafter the last working day of the temporary staff and CPFB was unable to identify \nwho had used the accounts": 5, "It is important that system access is given on a need \nbasis and removed promptly when it is no longer needed to prevent unauthorised \naccess to confidential information in these systems": 5, "6\nOverview\nIn the audit of SCORE, AGO found that two officers who were not the system \nadministrators of the payroll processing system were given privileged access which \nallowed them to grant and amend the access rights of all users": 6, "In addition, there was a lack of proper system for \nreview of logs, which captured the activities carried out by privileged users in the \nsystem": 6, "These lapses exposed SCORE to security risks, including leakage of and \nunauthorised

that MSF did not review the logs on activities of its IT vendors and IT staff \nto identify possible unauthorised access to the IT systems supporting the Baby Bonus \nscheme and Child Care/Infant Care subsidy scheme": 6, "Over a period of 11 months, there \nwere 4,920 instances of access by the MSF\u2019s IT vendor staff, of which AGO found \nthat 595 instances were inappropriate and would warrant further investigation": 6, "For \nexample, AGO found 560 instances where the IT vendor staff had used a privileged \nsystem user account which did not belong to them to access the systems": 6, "These \nviolations of IT controls could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the \ndata in the systems, resulting in leakage of information or corruption of data used for \ncomputation of bonuses

"Public \nsector entities are accountable for putting in place adequate financial controls to \nensure proper monitoring and accounting of transactions and assets": 6, "7\nOverview\nAGO found instances of inadequate financial controls over payments, management \nof assets and contracting in public sector entities such as the Singapore Sports \nCouncil (SSC) (also known as Sport Singapore),

was \nobligated to pay its agent for site supervisory services incurred after March 2015": 15, "There was thus no assurance that the site supervisory services were not \nexcessive when the agent proceeded to separately engage site supervisory staff": 15, "The irregularities, coupled with the lack of clarity over the amount which MOH \nwould have to pay its agent for site supervisory staff, indicated a lack of controls and \ninadequate oversight by MOH in managing its financial transactions with its agent": 15, "MOH subsequently updated AGO that there was no duplication of services as \nthe number of staff engaged under the contract with its own site supervisory services \ncontractor (hereafter referred to as the Contract) had been reduced by five, which \ncorresponded with the five staff the agent subsequently hired": 15, "However, AGO noted \nthe following evidence which did not corroborate with MOH\u2019s explanation and could \nindicate excessive site supervisory

been scrutinised \nand the impact on overall project costs assessed by appropriate authorities before \nMOH committed to the expenditure": 16, "The fact that MOH was not aware of the agent\u2019s non-compliance \nindicated that it did not exercise adequate oversight on the agent": 16, "MOH explained to AGO that the in-principle approval arrangement put \nin place by its agent was not intended to be an approval to start work, but for the \nconsultants and contractors to carry out detailed pre-works to expedite the preparation \nbefore seeking formal approval for the variation": 16, "Nevertheless, MOH acknowledged \nthat there were instances where works had proceeded prior to obtaining formal \napproval and that its agent should have formally obtained MOH\u2019s approval for the \ndeviation from the variation approval process": 16, "AGO noted that the detailed pre-works included design amendments carried \nout by contractors which in AGO\u2019s view would incur time and costs, and commit \nMOH to paying for such pre-works": 17, "Hence, the in-principle approval arrangement \nhad in effect undermined the financial controls that MOH had put in place to ensure \nthat

27, "SSC could not produce adequate evidence or records to account for the whereabouts \nof these devices which AGO had enquired about in October 2016": 27, "SSC explained that the lack of records was due mainly to the fast-paced nature \nof events (that is, carnivals and stage games) in which the devices were given out, \nstaff turnover, staff oversight, and staff hired by its vendors for the events not being \naware of the need to maintain and keep proper records": 27, "Following the audit, SSC informed AGO that it was tracing available \ndocumentation to ascertain the whereabouts of the 1,396 units and would take \ndisciplinary actions against those found responsible for any lapses": 28, "Going forward, \nSSC would remind its staff to ensure that proper documentation is maintained for \nthe devices": 28, "For the audit of the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises \n(SCORE), AGO covered the following areas": 28, "AGO\u2019s audit revealed a number of lapses in SCORE which indicated \nweaknesses in SCORE\u2019s financial controls and administration across the areas \naudited": 28, "The lapses included weaknesses in the management of access rights and \ninadequate controls to detect unauthorised activities performed in the payroll system": 28, "and lapses in procurement and payment such as contracts signed by unauthorised \nsignatories, payments made although invoices were not certified by authorised \nofficers, overpayment due to use of wrong contractual rates and poor management \nof security deposits": 28, "Although some of the individual lapses may not be significant on their own, \ntaken together with the other lapses, they reflect a general lack of attention to the \nimportance of good financial administration of public funds and

significant weaknesses \nin the management of access rights and inadequate controls to detect unauthorised \nactivities in the Human Resource Information System (HRIS)": 29, "The HRIS contained \npersonnel and salary-related information on SCORE\u2019s employees and was used to \nprocess payroll": 29, "As a result, SCORE was exposed to the risks of leakage of and \nunauthorised changes to personnel and salary-related information": 29, "AGO noted that two Human Resource (HR) officers, who were not system \nadministrators, were given privileged user accounts which allowed them to grant and \namend the access rights of all HRIS users": 29, "Assigning officers with rights beyond their job scope, especially \nprivileged access rights, would expose SCORE to security risks, including leakage \nof and unauthorised changes to personnel and salary-related information": 29, "Furthermore, SCORE did not have a proper system in place to review logs \nwhich captured the activities carried out by privileged users in HRIS": 29, "As a result, \nSCORE would not be able to promptly detect unauthorised activities carried out by \nthe privileged users and to carry out prompt investigations of any such incidents": 29, "Although SCORE explained that its internal auditors had reviewed one of \nthe logs on a half-yearly basis as part of their checks, AGO is of the view that the \ncheck was not effective because it was conducted on extracts of logs provided by the \nprivileged users themselves": 29, "These privileged users could edit the logs to suppress \ninformation on any unauthorised activities which they had carried out": 29, "In addition, \nthe review of the logs on a half-yearly basis was contrary to Government\u2019s best \npractices which recommend that such checks be carried out on a monthly basis": 29, "AGO further noted that SCORE was not familiar with the logs available in \nthe HRIS including the purposes of the logs, which would undermine its ability to \ndesign an effective system of controls to prevent and detect security violations and \nunauthorised activities": 29, "SCORE informed AGO that it had since taken action to remove the privileged \naccess rights from the two HR officers and had performed a holistic review of the \naccess rights granted to all officers to ensure that access rights were granted based \non job needs and that there was a robust segregation of duties": 30, "SCORE also added \nthat it had since been working with its vendor to document the logs available and \nupdate its manuals, targeted to be completed by September 2017": 30,

Government\u2019s instructions": 30, "AGO\u2019s review of SCORE\u2019s procedures for processing monthly salary payment \nrevealed that there were inadequate controls to detect unauthorised changes made \nto payroll records and the softcopy file sent to the bank for salary payment": 30, "AGO noted that the HR officer who prepared payroll could single-handedly \nmake changes to payroll records in HRIS": 30, "While such changes were checked by \nthe reviewers, the checks were only on the changes manually highlighted by the HR \nofficer himself": 30, "The review would not be effective as the HR officer could suppress \nany unauthorised changes which he made by not highlighting them": 30, "Although \nthere was a reconciling check on the total number of employees and amounts, such \na check was carried out at the overall level and would not be effective in detecting \nunauthorised changes made at the individual record level": 30, "AGO also noted that since April 2014, the softcopy salary payment file sent to \nthe bank for payment was an unencrypted and editable text file, and hence not protected \nfrom unauthorised changes": 30, "AGO observed that while the bank signatories performed \nchecks on the total number of employees and amounts before approving the payment, the \nchecks (which were carried out at the overall level) would not be effective in detecting \nchanges to the individual payroll records": 30, "SCORE informed AGO that it had started to encrypt the salary payment file \nsent to the bank with effect from February 2017": 31, "To ensure that no unauthorised \nchanges were made to staff salaries prior to February 2017, SCORE would verify \nall salary payments made during the period from April 2014 to January 2017": 31, "SCORE also indicated that it would \nenhance the HRIS to prevent and detect tampering of payroll records": 31, "SCORE acknowledged that substantial improvements are required to strengthen \nthe governance and controls over HRIS": 31, "SCORE informed AGO that it would work \nwith its supervising ministry to create a comprehensive checklist of controls for HRIS, \nprovide training to familiarise its HR officers with the system functionalities and build \nup the skills and competency of the HR officers": 31, "SCORE would also be migrating to a \nrobust mainstream public service HR and payroll system, which comprised processes \nthat adhered to best practices in controls, by the end of 2018": 31, "71 million had been made even \nthough the 63 invoices for these payments were not certified by authorised officers": 31, "There were also lapses in the procurement and contract management process, which \nincluded not using an installed system for more than two years, overpayments due \nto use of wrong contractual rates and the administration of security deposits": 31, "These lapses, taken together, point to lax administration and lack of due care \nin handling procurement and payment matters": 31, "As a result, the controls put in place \nto safeguard SCORE\u2019s interests had been bypassed, and public funds had been wasted \non unnecessary services and overpayments": 31, "AGO\u2019s test checks of 16 contracts signed from 2014 to 2016 revealed that 10 \ncontracts with values ranging from $1": 32, "It is important that contracts are signed by the appropriate authorities appointed by \nSCORE\u2019s Board": 32, "Not doing so bypasses the controls instituted to safeguard SCORE\u2019s \ninterest of having sufficiently senior officers scrutinise the terms and conditions of \nthe contracts before executing them": 32, "SCORE explained that the staff involved in managing the contracting \ndocumentation was not familiar with the requirements in SCORE\u2019s Financial \nRegulations and had erroneously sent the contracts to the officer (mentioned in \nparagraph 33) for his signature": 32, "SCORE informed AGO that it had ratified the 10 contracts and conducted \nchecks to ensure that all existing contracts were signed by the correct contract \nsignatories": 32, "SCORE had also implemented measures to ensure that contract \nsignatories were made aware of their financial approval limits and for its internal \nauditors to conduct checks to ensure compliance with SCORE\u2019s Financial Regulations": 32, "SCORE also informed AGO that it had conducted procurement courses in April 2017 \nto familiarise its officers with procurement guidelines": 32, "SCORE explained that the authorised certifying officers had informally delegated \nthe certifying functions to other officers": 32, "For proper accountability, delegations of the \ncertifying functions should be done formally with proper documentation, taking into \naccount the amounts involved and the seniority of officers required to scrutinise the \ninvoices before payments": 32, "SCORE acknowledged that certifying officers play an important internal control \nfunction in the payment process": 33, "SCORE informed AGO that it had since conducted a \nthorough review of its payment process, and had sought its Board\u2019s approval to revise \nits Financial Regulations on 18 May 2017": 33, "Under the revised Financial Regulations, \npayments would only be made against duly certified original documents": 33, "SCORE \nalso indicated that warrants had been issued to the certifying officers in June 2017 to \ninform them of their responsibilities and financial approval limits": 33, "The lapses \nincluded over-specifying requirements, using wrong contractual rates resulting in \noverpayment to contractors, and not using a system that had been installed for more \nthan two years": 33, "SCORE called the tender in July 2014 for the provision of logistical \nexpertise to manage distribution and warehouse operations for a period of two years \ncommencing in April 2015, with an option to extend for another two years": 33, "The tender had \nincluded the requirement of managing a new warehouse in addition to two existing \nwarehouses, even though the new warehouse was still in the planning stage": 33, "The tenderers would have factored the cost of managing the new warehouse in their \ntender prices which were submitted as a lump sum amount": 33, "AGO noted that the \nmonthly warehouse management fee quoted by the contractor amounted to $35,000 \nper month for all three warehouses or $840,000 for the contract period of two years": 33, "SCORE acknowledged that the services for the new warehouse should \nhave been stated as an optional requirement in the tender": 34, "It had \nverbally informed potential tenderers that no additional manpower was required for \nthe new warehouse and that the tenderers would only be required to transfer goods \nfrom the collection point to other warehouses, when necessary": 34, "Although SCORE \nacknowledged that no tender briefing notes were recorded (which should have been \ndone), SCORE was of the view that the manpower submissions by all the tenderers \nwho had attended the briefing clearly showed that the tenderers were fully aware \nthat no manpower was required for the new warehouse": 34, "SCORE added that it should \nhave issued a corrigendum to clarify its intent on the use for the new warehouse": 34, "AGO noted that the contract had included the new warehouse without stating \nthat the new warehouse would serve only as a collection point": 34, "There was hence \nno assurance that the tenderers had not factored in the cost of manpower for the \nnew warehouse": 34, "The \nuncertainty over whether SCORE was charged for services at the new warehouse \ncould have been avoided if SCORE had been more diligent in administering the \nprocurement process": 34, "SCORE had overpaid the contractor for the provision of additional manpower \nfor the period from January to June 2016 due to the use of a wrong contractual rate": 34, "SCORE had incorrectly used the rate for overtime work instead of the rate for the \nprovision of additional manpower stipulated in the contract": 34, "An electronic attendance recording system installed in April 2015 by the \ncontractor, as required under the contract, was left unused": 34, "There was no evidence that SCORE \nhad carried out a proper analysis before including this item in the tender": 34, "As the \ncontractor would have factored in its tender price the cost of installing the system, \nSCORE had wasted public funds on a system which was not used for a large part \nof the contract period": 34, "SCORE subsequently looked into the implementation issues after AGO\u2019s \nqueries and informed AGO that it would start using the system from June 2017": 35, "SCORE also informed AGO that it would work closely \nwith its supervising ministry to put in place a comprehensive procurement and \ncontract management framework and step up training of its procurement officers \nto ensure that they are competent at their procurement functions": 35, "The nature of the various lapses, when taken together, points \nto a lax attitude in administering security deposits": 35, "For example, for two tenders called for the same \ntype of goods and with the same payment terms, security deposit was \ncollected for one tender but not for the other": 35, "Further checks revealed \nthat decisions on security deposits were made without a proper risk \nassessment to determine whether there was a need to collect the security \ndeposits and the quantum to collect": 35, "As the cost of providing security \ndeposits would inevitably be passed back to SCORE in the form of \nhigher tender prices, decisions on security deposits should not be \ntaken lightly": 35, "A proper risk assessment should be carried out, taking \ninto account the need to protect the agency\u2019s interests and the cost that \ntenderers might factor into their tender prices": 35, "The decisions made by the Tender Approving Authorities on the collection \nof security deposits for two tenders were not correctly implemented": 35, "For \none tender, security deposit was collected even though the decision was \nnot to collect, and vice versa for the other tender": 35, "SCORE informed AGO that it would make a proper assessment and adopt a \nrisk-based approach regarding the imposition of security deposits and the quantum to \ncollect": 35, "For the audit of the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB), AGO covered the \nfollowing areas in its test checks": 36, "AGO noted lapses in CPFB\u2019s management of two IT security monitoring \nsystems which tracked the activities of its databases and systems": 36, "The lapses \nincluded not reviewing changes made to the IT security monitoring systems and \nincomplete reports generated for review of potential IT security violations": 36, "There \nwas also no policy to identify IT systems that should be tracked by one of the IT \nsecurity monitoring systems": 36, "These lapses could affect the effectiveness of the two \nIT security monitoring systems in detecting IT security violations": 36, "For the IT security monitoring system that tracked IT activities on CPFB\u2019s \ndatabases, AGO noted the following lapses": 37, "5 years after the system was implemented in March 2015, \nand had only done so in September 2016 after AGO commenced its \naudit": 37, "As a result, it would not be possible to ascertain if unauthorised \nchanges had been made to the system prior to September 2016": 37, "Unauthorised changes to the system increase the risk of IT security \nviolations not being detected and consequently, mitigated or prevented \nin a timely manner": 37, "After CPFB commenced reviewing changes made to this IT security \nmonitoring system, AGO\u2019s checks on all three instances of changes \ncarried out found that for one instance, a system administrator did not \nmake three approved changes but instead made six changes which \nhad not been approved": 37, "The administrator\u2019s supervisors who had \nreviewed the changes also failed to detect the discrepancies": 37, "The IT security monitoring system was not configured properly to \nprovide complete alert reports on IT security violations detected": 37, "AGO \nnoted that the reports generated for CPFB\u2019s review did not capture \nthe activities on a particular day of each

\nGovernment ministries and organs of state)": 2, "In selecting areas for audit, AGO considers factors such as financial value of \ntransactions and the potential impact an irregularity in a particular area may have \non the organisation or the public sector as a whole": 2, "As AGO\u2019s audits are conducted on a test check basis, they do not reveal all \nirregularities and weaknesses": 2, "The irregularities and weaknesses uncovered do not necessarily reflect the general \nstate of administration in the entities audited, but point to the areas where improvement \nshould be made in

"The Public Accounts Committee deliberates \non the Report and may call upon public sector entities to account for lapses, where \nit deems necessary": 3, "Audit Observations\nIn this year\u2019s audits, AGO uncovered a number of instances that indicated laxity in \nthe administration of grants": 3, "The common weaknesses observed include failure by \nthe public sector entities to ensure that the correct amount of grants are disbursed \nand conditions for grants are adhered to": 3, "For proper accountability, it is important \nthat controls and proper mechanisms are in place to ensure that grants are used for \nthe intended purposes": 3, "AGO also observed several instances of lapses in tendering and management of \nrevenue contracts, and poor management of contract variations": 3, "These lapses raised \nconcerns on whether the key principles of open and fair competition, and transparency \nhad been upheld": 3, "Our audit observations also revealed related party transactions, involving substantial \namounts, which were not carried out at arm\u2019s length": 3, "Related parties were not charged \nor were charged below market rate for goods and services provided by the public \nsector entities": 3, "In this Overview, I would like to highlight the following areas where public sector \nentities could pay greater attention to and where improvements could be made": 3, "4\nOverview\nAdministration of Grants\nSignificant amounts of grants are disbursed every year for various Government \nprogrammes and projects": 4, "As public funds are involved, it is important that adequate \ncontrols and monitoring mechanisms are in place to track the use of grants and to \nmonitor that grants disbursed have achieved their intended purposes": 4, "The National Research Foundation (NRF) was lax in reviewing progress reports \nsubmitted by its grant recipients to ensure that the funded projects were on schedule \nand met key project milestones": 4, "In particular, there were instances where the project \nmilestones were not met but NRF had not taken any follow-up action": 4, "AGO also \nobserved that the Ministry of Health had overpaid its grant recipients over three \nfinancial years due to wrong computation of rental subvention and the overpayment \nwould be perpetuated if it is not detected and rectified": 4, "Public sector entities also engaged external parties as programme partners to \nadminister grants on their behalf": 4, "AGO found that the Singapore Workforce \nDevelopment Agency was lax in its monitoring of a programme partner": 4, "It did not \nensure that its programme partner enforced grant conditions on the grant recipients \nand adhered to the funding caps which it had set": 4, "When public sector entities partner \nother parties to administer their grants, it is necessary for the entities to have adequate \noversight of their partners to ensure that grants are properly disbursed and programme \nrequirements enforced": 4, "Tendering and Management of Revenue Contracts\nPublic sector entities award a significant amount of contracts for vendors to operate \nbusinesses on the entities\u2019 premises": 4, "In \nawarding these revenue contracts, it is important that the entities uphold the principles \nof transparency, and open and fair competition, and obtain proper approvals for \naward of contracts": 4, "The operators\u2019 performance should also be properly monitored \nto ensure that they fulfil the contractual requirements": 4, "5\nOverview\nIn the audit of the People\u2019s Association (PA), AGO found instances where training \noperators were engaged directly by grassroots organisations (GROs) without calling \ncompetitive bids": 5, "In addition, AGO observed many instances where \napprovals for award of revenue contracts were obtained from the wrong approving \nauthorities": 5, "Consequently, the awards of the contracts were not subject to the scrutiny \nof the relevant approving authorities": 5, "This undermined the role of the approving \nauthorities which is to ensure that the principles of revenue contracting are upheld": 5, "AGO also found lapses in the management of revenue contracts in the Institute of \nTechnical Education (ITE)": 5, "There is a need to hold operators accountable \nand take firm action against errant operators when warranted": 5, "Management of Contract Variations\nPublic sector entities typically raise contract variations for an incumbent contractor \nto carry out variation works when there are changes to the original contract due to \nunforeseen circumstances or requirements": 5, "Public sector entities are expected to carry \nout reasonableness checks on the prices of goods and services and obtain approval \nbefore awarding the contract variations": 5, "This is to ensure that the Government \nprocurement principles of value for money and, open and fair competition are \nadhered to": 5, "AGO found lapses in controls over management of contract variations in the \nNational Parks Board, the National Population and Talent Division and the \nJurong Town Corporation": 5, "There were many instances where approvals for contract \nvariations were obtained only after works had commenced, or worse still, only after \nworks had been completed and payments made": 5, "Obtaining retrospective approvals \nfor variations weakens the controls put in place to ensure that variations are properly \njustified and that the approving authority has adequate oversight of project costs": 5, "6\nOverview\nRelated Party Transactions\nIn carrying out their functions, public sector entities may have dealings with parties \nthat are related to them": 6, "While AGO recognises that many of these related parties \nare established to complement the public sector entities\u2019 functions, they are, after \nall, separate legal entities accountable for their own performance": 6, "Therefore, for \nproper accountability, transactions with related parties should be carried out at arm\u2019s \nlength, and funding and resources provided to the related parties should be clearly \nreflected": 6, "AGO observed instances in two public sector entities where transactions with related \nparties were not carried out at arm\u2019s length": 6, "It had also waived a \nsubstantial amount due from this related party without carrying out proper evaluation": 6, "In addition, SP did not recover a significant amount of costs for secondment of its \nstaff to a subsidiary": 6, "ITE \nalso did not have a proper system to ensure complete, correct and prompt billing of \nservices rendered to the subsidiary": 6, "Importance of Proper Documentation\nIn addition to the above observations, I am concerned over the lack of documentation \non decisions, actions taken and matters with significant financial implications in the \nareas audited": 6, "In this year\u2019s audit, AGO found a number of instances where public \nsector entities, in response to lapses highlighted by AGO, explained that they had \ntaken actions in the past based on certain justifications but they were not able to \nprovide supporting documentation": 6, "For example, AGO was informed that verbal \napprovals were obtained or discussions were carried out but these were not recorded": 6, "AGO is aware that maintaining records requires time and effort, and hence AGO does \nnot expect every issue to be recorded": 6, "However, AGO is concerned when entities \nare unable to produce any evidence of what they have represented to AGO as key \nconsiderations when decisions were made at the material point in time": 6, "7\nOverview\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge the co-operation given to AGO by the ministries, organs \nof state, statutory boards, Government-owned companies and other entities audited": 7, "I would also like to express my appreciation to all my officers for maintaining high \nprofessional standards

contracts and not alerting the relevant approving \nauthority that the APV would be exceeded, the authority would not have the opportunity \nto consider the increased costs in the context of the original justifications for the \ndevelopment project": 31, "ITE explained that it awarded the works via separate contracts instead of \nvariations to the main contract as the contractor could use the variation works to \nrequest for extension of time and it understood that the contractor had the intention \nto do so": 31, "According to ITE, this would delay the completion of the project which \nwas on a fast-track schedule": 31, "AGO was informed by ITE that it did not have records of project meetings \nand discussions to substantiate that the justification explained in paragraph 52 was \nconsidered at that stage": 32, "With regard to the contractor\u2019s intention to request for \nextension, AGO noted from the report of ITE\u2019s consultant that, before the separate \ncontracts for the additional works were awarded, the contractor had committed \nto complete the additional works within the timeline of the main building works \ncontract": 32, "In addition, urgency did not turn out to be a real issue as \nITE took half a year to award the additional works to the contractor": 32, "Regardless of \nthe procurement method, the important point is that ITE did not alert the

seven late payments (totalling $14": 33, "Such delays might be seen as unfair as it could affect \nthe cash flows of the contractors and consultants": 33, "ITE explained that the delays were due to the need to ensure that defects were \npromptly rectified by the contractor before payments were made": 33, "AGO noted that \nat the time when ITE responded to the contractor\u2019s payment claim, it had already \nestablished the amount that should be paid (that is, it had excluded the amounts \npertaining to defects which needed to be rectified)": 33, "AGO\u2019s test checks revealed that ITE was

"Deductions are to be made to the \nmonthly charge for unavailability of facilities and service performance shortfalls by \nthe company, and adjustments are to be made for any change in operating

agreement provides for the monthly charge payable by ITE to be adjusted in \naccordance with changes in the operating costs": 35, "AGO noted that ITE had not assessed \nwhether variation works carried out (amounting to $952,900 as at September 2014) \nwould affect operating costs and consequently the monthly charge payable to the \ncompany": 35, "Some of these variation works had been completed and handed over to \nITE as far back as in April 2012": 35, "In the event that the operating costs are reduced as a result of these variation \nworks and no adjustments are made, ITE would be paying the

as \ntime passes": 35, "ITE explained that as the PPP arrangement was new in Singapore, there \nwere limited data on how changes in operating costs due to variation works should \nbe ascertained, for determining the required adjustment to the monthly charge": 35, "Under the agreement, annual utility services consumption targets10 are set \nand these have to be reviewed periodically by ITE": 35, "AGO noted that ITE had not \ncarried out any review of the targets since the commencement of services in 2010": 35, "The targets are intended to incentivise the company to control the actual utility \nconsumption since it gets to share in any savings11, so that over time, ITE will pay \nless for utility consumption": 35, "Periodic review of targets should be carried out to take \ninto account changes in the use of the facilities": 35, "11 If the actual consumption in a period is outside the range of 10 per cent from the targets, the \ncompany would co-share 50 per cent of the amount (additional costs or cost savings) outside the \nrange of 10 per cent of the targets": 35, "ITE explained that it has been monitoring the utility consumption and noted \nthat the consumption was lower than the targets": 36, "ITE has therefore made an interim \narrangement with the company for ITE to reimburse the latter based on actual \nconsumption": 36, "Both ITE and the company wanted to do away

the changes promptly and sought the necessary approval \nbefore implementing the changes": 36, "AGO found irregularities in the award and management of contracts for \nthe appointment of a cafeteria operator and a swimming pool operator at ITE": 36, "The \nirregularities included awarding a contract to a tenderer which did not meet an \nevaluation criterion, inadequate monitoring of operators\u2019 compliance with contractual \nrequirements, delays in signing contracts, and extending a contract without requisite \napproval": 36, "There was laxity in managing the contracting process, and the key principles \nof open and fair competition, transparency and maximising total returns were not \nupheld": 36, "ITE called an open tender in 2010 to appoint an operator for a cafeteria and \nstudent caf\u00e9 on one of its campuses for a period of three years with an option to \ncontinue for another three years": 36, "ITE awarded the contract to a tenderer which was

with certain contractual requirements": 37, "The operator \nwas awarded the contract on the bases that, among other things, \nits commitment to invest in renovation was the highest among the \ntenderers": 37, "There was, however, no evidence that ITE monitored and \nensured the fulfilment of investment commitment by the operator": 37, "There were also other instances where ITE did not take enforcement \naction against the operator when it failed to meet contractual \nrequirements": 37, "The swimming pool operator was initially appointed under a Memorandum \nof Understanding in August 2005 and subsequently, under three contracts from \nApril 2008 till July 2015": 37, "The three contracts were signed one to eight months after the operator \nhad commenced operating the swimming pool": 37, "During the interim \nperiod, ITE would not have any contractual right and consequently, \nits interests would not have been properly safeguarded": 37, "There was no monitoring on whether the operator purchased the \nrequired public liability insurance for swimming pool users under \nthe three contracts": 37, "AGO observed that since the commencement of \nthe first contract in April 2008 till the time of audit in October 2014, \nthe operator had only purchased the insurance for a two-year period \nfrom January 2011 to December 2012": 37, "Approval to extend the second contract for a year was obtained \ntwo months after the offer for extension had been made to the \noperator": 37, "In doing so, ITE bypassed the controls put in place to \nensure that contract extension is properly justified and scrutinised \nby the appropriate authority before implementation": 37, "For the third contract, ITE reduced the contract period from three \nto two years so as to lower the estimated total revenue to avoid the \nneed to call tender and seek endorsement from the relevant authority, \nthereby avoiding the more stringent controls put in place for tenders": 38, "It is important for ITE to evaluate tender offers in accordance with the \npublished criteria so as to uphold the principles of transparency, and fair and open \ncompetition": 38, "There is also a need for proper monitoring of operators\u2019 performance \nand enforcement of contractual requirements": 38, "ITE acknowledged the lapses and indicated that it would take appropriate \nactions against its

\nspecified that ITEES was to pay the licence fee to ITE on a quarterly basis, without \nstating when payment would be due and the interest payable for late payment": 39, "ITE also indicated that it
