      "    \"1\": \"1\\nOVERVIEW\\nI am pleased to present my Report on the audits carried out by the Auditor-General\\u2019s \\nOffice (AGO) for the financial year 2021/22.\\nThe audits give assurance to the President and Parliament on the proper accounting, \\nmanagement and use of public resources.  In the process, they help strengthen financial \\ngovernance of the public service and enhance the accountability of public sector \\nentities as custodians and stewards of public resources.\\nAudit Authority\\nThe Auditor-General\\u2019s authority to audit and report is provided for in legislation. \\n \\nThe key legislation that governs AGO\\u2019s work are the Constitution of the Republic of \\nSingapore and the Audit Act 1966.  \\nThe details of AGO\\u2019s audit authority are inAnnex I.\\nAGO audits the accounts of all Government departments and offices.  AGO also \\naudits public authorities and bodies administering public funds as prescribed by law, \\nor upon request and with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  In general, AGO \\ncarries out the following types of audits:\\n\\u2022 \\nFinancial statements audit which involves the checking of accounts with \\nthe objective of giving an audit opinion on the annual financial statements \\nprepared by the entity.\\n\\u2022 \\nSelective audit which involves the checking of selected activities and \\noperations, carried out in relation to the accounts, for financial irregularity, and \\nto ascertain whether there has been excess, extravagance or gross inefficiency \\nleading to waste, and whether measures to prevent them are in place.  Such \\nan audit is not intended to render an opinion on the financial statements or \\ndraw any conclusion on the overall performance of the audited entity.\\n\\u2022 \\nThematic audit which is an in-depth examination of a selected area and may \\ninvolve more than one public sector entity.  The in-depth examination enables \\nAGO to report on good practices in financial governance and controls that it \\nmay come across in the course of the audit, in addition to lapses.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"2\": \"2\\nOverview\\nAudit Approach\\nAGO adopts a risk-based approach in determining the areas to be covered in an audit. \\nIn selecting areas for audit, one of the key factors AGO considers is the materiality of \\ntransactions.  Dollar value is an important consideration in determining materiality \\nbut it is not the only consideration.  AGO also considers other factors such as the \\npotential impact an irregularity in a particular area may have on the entity or the \\npublic sector as a whole.\\nIn carrying out the audit, AGO examines records, files, reports and other documents, \\nconducts site visits and interviews relevant officers.  AGO also considers internal \\ncontrols that entities have put in place to safeguard resources against waste, loss and \\nmisuse in the selected areas of audit.  The audit observations reported are based on \\nthe information and evidence so gathered.  As audits are conducted on a test check \\nbasis, they do not reveal all irregularities and weaknesses.  However, they should \\nhelp to uncover some of the serious lapses.\\nReporting of Audit Observations\\nAll audit observations are conveyed to the Permanent Secretaries of the respective \\nGovernment ministries, Heads of the respective organs of state and the Chief \\nExecutives of the respective statutory boards and other entities by way of AGO \\nManagement Letters, which also incorporate the entity\\u2019s management comments.  In \\nthe case of statutory boards, the Management Letters are also sent to the Permanent \\nSecretaries of their respective supervising ministries.\\nThe more significant audit observations are covered in this Report.  These are typically \\nobservations which indicate malfeasance, lapses with significant financial impact, \\nsystemic or common lapses that may seriously weaken financial governance and \\ncontrols if not corrected, or serve as useful learning points for improvements across \\nthe Whole-of-Government.\\nThis Report is submitted to the President who shall, in accordance with section 3(3) of \\nthe \\nAudit \\nAct 1966, present it to Parliament.  The Public \\nAccounts Committee deliberates \\n \\non the Report and may call upon public sector entities to account for lapses, where \\nit deems necessary.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"3\": \"3\\nOverview\\nThe reporting of audit observations in the Report of the Auditor-General is an essential \\npart of the system of public accountability.\\nAudits Carried Out for the Financial Year 2021/22\\nAGO audited the following:\\n\\u2022\\t\\nThe Government Financial Statements (incorporating the accounts of all 16 \\nGovernment ministries and 8 organs of state)\\n\\u2022\\t\\n3 Government funds\\n\\u2022\\t\\n10 statutory boards\\n\\u2022\\t\\n4 Government-owned companies\\n\\u2022\\t\\n2 other accounts\\nFinancial Statements Audits\\nFor the financial year 2021/22, I have issued an unmodified audit opinion on the \\nGovernment Financial Statements.  I have also issued unmodified audit opinions on \\nthe financial statements of three statutory boards, four Government-owned companies \\nand two other accounts.\\nSelective Audits\\nAGO carried out selective audits of four statutory boards and three Government \\nfunds whose financial statements were not audited by AGO.\\nThematic Audit\\nAGO conducted a thematic audit on selected Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) \\nrelated procurement and expenditure managed by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), \\nthe Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).\\nIn addition to the above audits, AGO carried out checks on Government ministries, \\norgans of state and statutory boards arising from matters that come to AGO\\u2019s attention \\nthrough observations from past audits, feedback or complaints.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"4\": \"4\\nOverview\\nSummary of Audit Observations\\nAGO\\u2019s audit observations for the financial year 2021/22 have been conveyed to the \\npublic sector entities concerned through AGO Management Letters for their follow-up. \\nThe more significant audit observations are highlighted in this Report.\\nThe key areas are as follows:\\n\\u2022 \\nLapses in management of grants\\n\\u2022 \\nLapses in management of operations\\n\\u2022 \\nWeaknesses in procurement and contract management\\n\\u2022 \\nPossible irregularities in records furnished for audit\\n\\u2022 \\nCOVID-19 related procurement and expenditure\\n(1)\\t\\nLapses in Management of Grants\\nAGO found lapses in the management of grants by the SkillsFuture Singapore \\nAgency (SSG), resulting in estimated overpayments totalling $4.22 million.  There \\nwas inadequate monitoring by SSG and its outsourced service provider to ensure \\nthat grants disbursed for individuals, employers and training providers were valid, \\ncorrect and in compliance with the grant terms and conditions.\\nLapses noted included: (i) grants disbursed for individuals and companies that either \\ndid not meet the grant eligibility criteria or were disallowed funding, (ii) grants \\ndisbursed for individuals who had attended two or more sessions for different courses \\nat the same time and (iii) inadequate checks for absentee payroll funding.\\n(2)\\t\\nLapses in Management of Operations\\nAGO noted lapses in the management of operations at some public sector entities, \\nincluding the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and SSG.\\nFor MSF, AGO found lapses in controls over cash and supermarket vouchers at two \\nSocial Service Offices (SSOs).  Officers in the SSOs did not carry out required checks \\non the cash and supermarket vouchers but had signed off the logbooks indicating \\nthat they had done so.  The checks by the officers were important as they served as \\nindependent checks on another SSO officer who had sole custody of the key and \\npasscode to the safe containing the cash and supermarket vouchers.   \\n\",\n",
      "    \"5\": \"5\\nOverview\\nFor SSG, AGO noted that it was lax in its enforcement of outstanding Skills \\nDevelopment Levy\\u00a0(SDL) collections.  Based on SSG\\u2019s records, the estimated \\noutstanding SDL was $43 million as at April 2022.  This amount was owed for the \\nperiod 2015 to 2020.  SSG was tardy in its enforcement actions and did not put in \\nadequate effort to conduct audits of employers which potentially owed significant \\namounts of SDL.  SSG should exercise greater due diligence and take adequate \\nenforcement actions to recover the outstanding SDL in a timely manner.  The longer \\nthe SDL remains unpaid/underpaid, the lower the likelihood of recovery. \\n(3)\\t\\nWeaknesses in Procurement and Contract Management\\nAGO observed weaknesses in procurement and contract management at a few \\npublic sector entities, including the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Ministry \\nof Communications and Information (MCI), and the Public Utilities Board (PUB).\\nAGO found lapses in the management of contract variations by MHA and its \\nconsultants for the main construction contracts under two development projects.  The \\nlapses included: (i) inadequate assessment of cost reasonableness of star rate items, \\n(ii) lapses in valuations of contract variations and (iii) no supporting documents \\nto substantiate payments made for variations involving dayworks.  These lapses \\nindicated weaknesses in the monitoring of contract variations and inadequate \\noversight of the consultants by MHA.\\nAGO audited the Whole-of-Government Period Contract and Framework Agreement \\n(WOG PCFA) on creative services for communications campaigns which was \\nadministered by MCI.  Under the WOG PCFA, public sector agencies can procure \\ncreative services from vendors appointed on the panel and at awarded prices which \\nMCI had evaluated.  AGO noted that when MCI called the tender to appoint the \\npanel of vendors, the tender document did not state clearly the unit of measurement \\nfor certain items that tenderers were supposed to quote for.  This resulted in different \\nvendors using different units of measurement when the public sector agencies \\nsubsequently procured the services.  AGO also noted that during the tender evaluation, \\nMCI did not ascertain whether the tenderers had quoted on a like-for-like basis for \\nitems where the quotes submitted varied significantly. \\n\",\n",
      "    \"6\": \"6\\nOverview\\nAGO also noted that MCI, as the sector lead, did not monitor the spread of contracts \\nawarded to vendors on the panel.  There were a total of 39 vendors on the panel.  As at \\n31 December 2021, the top vendor (by procurement value) was awarded 38 per cent \\n \\nof total procurement value.  The next two highest vendors (by procurement value) \\nwere awarded contracts totalling 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.  It is important \\nto have a good spread of business opportunities to encourage vendors to bid for future \\ntenders.  This in turn will ensure that public sector agencies can continue to enjoy \\ncompetitive prices in the long run.\\nAGO also carried out test checks on procurement made by PUB under the WOG \\nPCFA.  AGO observed (i) lapses in PUB\\u2019s assessment of cost reasonableness of \\nthird-party items, (ii) payments made for third-party items without verifying against \\nsupporting invoices and (iii) incorrect application of the WOG PCFA rates, resulting \\nin an overpayment to the vendor.\\n(4)\\t\\nPossible Irregularities in Records Furnished for Audit \\nAGO noted possible irregularities in the records furnished for AGO\\u2019s checks in the \\naudits of MHA, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and SLA.\\nFor MHA, AGO\\u2019s test checks found possible irregularities in quotations provided \\nfor a substantial number of star rate items for two construction contracts. \\n \\nIn the audit of NEA, AGO found possible irregularities in some quotations submitted \\nas part of applications for a grant scheme administered by NEA. \\nFor SLA, AGO found tell-tale signs that cast doubt on the authenticity of quotations \\nsubmitted by a contractor to substantiate price reasonableness for some of the \\nrequired services. \\nFollowing AGO\\u2019s observations, the agencies have lodged reports with the \\nrelevant authorities.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"7\": \"7\\nOverview\\n(5)\\t\\nCOVID-19 Related Procurement and Expenditure\\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic was unprecedented in scale and speed of spread. \\nThe Government had to act decisively and respond swiftly to protect Singapore and \\nSingaporeans from the threat to lives and livelihoods.  Within a short period of time, \\nmany public sector agencies had to take on new roles and functions in addition to \\ntheir usual operations.  They had to act quickly to ensure that essential services were \\ndelivered, new services implemented and critical supplies secured.  Procurement \\ndecisions had to be made in tandem with the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. \\n \\nThe uncertain and fluid situation in 2020 and 2021 also posed greater operational \\nrisks to public sector agencies.\\nTo help agencies with their COVID-19 related procurement, the Ministry of Finance \\nimplemented a number of measures, such as the central activation of Emergency \\nProcurement (EP) procedures at the WOG level in late January 2020.  All agencies \\nwere also required to submit an Accountability Report, documenting all EP decisions, \\nto their Permanent Secretaries for endorsement.\\nAGO carried out a thematic audit on selected COVID-19 related procurement and \\nexpenditure managed by three agencies, namely HPB, SLA and MOM.\\nHPB, SLA and MOM incurred a total of $1.51 billion on COVID-19 expenditure \\nrelating to manpower services, accommodation facilities and meal catering for the \\nperiod 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2021.  AGO test-checked a total of 985 samples \\ncovering contracts, payments and contract variations under the three agencies.  The \\ntotal amount of expenditure test-checked was $264.93 million (or 18 per cent out of \\nthe $1.51 billion expenditure incurred during the audit period).  Key observations \\nacross the four stages of procurement and contract management are summarised below.\\nStage 1 - Planning and Establishing Needs\\nHPB, SLA and MOM generally had processes in place to establish needs when \\nplanning for their COVID-19 related procurement.  Based on AGO\\u2019s test checks, \\napproval of requirement for the intended procurement was obtained from the \\nauthorised approving officer to ensure that needs were properly established.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"8\": \"8\\nOverview\\nStage 2 - Procurement and Contracting\\nHPB, SLA and MOM had generally adopted direct contracting for their COVID-19 \\nrelated procurement with the activation of EP, given the extreme urgency.  There \\nwere established approving authorities and financial limits to approve contract \\nawards.  In general, agreements were entered into with contractors for the required \\nworks and services.\\nHowever, there were areas where controls could be improved.  For SLA and MOM, \\nAGO noted lapses in the evaluation of proposals and assessment of price reasonableness \\nas well as discrepancies and omissions in submissions to the approving authority \\nfor contract award.  There were also delays in obtaining approvals for contract \\nawards.  For all three agencies, there was a need to improve on the documentation \\nof assessments carried out.\\nStage 3 - Managing Contracts\\nSLA and MOM had established approving authorities and financial limits to approve \\ncontract variations.  Generally, contract variation agreements were entered into with \\nthe contractors.  For payments, HPB, SLA and MOM generally had processes in place \\nto ensure that payments were supported, approved and paid in a timely manner.  There \\nwere also established approving authority matrices for the approval of payments. \\nNevertheless, AGO noted areas where the controls for SLA and MOM could be \\nimproved.  AGO found instances where there were delays in obtaining approvals for \\ncontract variations and execution of variation agreements.  AGO also noted lapses \\nin payment processes such as inadequate checks on the validity of payments, lack of \\nsupporting documents for payments and discrepancies in payment claims.\\nStage 4 - Closure/Renewal of Contracts\\nHPB, SLA and MOM generally had processes in place for closure/renewal of \\ncontracts.  HPB had put in place a set of criteria to assess the suitability of swab \\npersonnel for contract extension/renewal and scheme conversion.  SLA and MOM had \\nprocesses in place to monitor the start and end dates of contracts, and to discontinue \\nthose contracts when services were no longer needed.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"9\": \"9\\nOverview\\nAGO noted that HPB could not locate documents relating to the extension/renewal/\\nconversion of contracts for swab personnel.  HPB should also ensure timely \\ndeactivation of accounts of terminated personnel in the payment system.\\nGood Practices\\nAGO observed a number of good practices that the three agencies had implemented \\nto better manage operations and the uncertainty in demand, as well as to reduce costs. \\nHPB established the Testing Operations Tasking Group in April 2020 to be overall \\nresponsible for the command, control, welfare and discipline of the many teams of \\nswab personnel operating on the ground.  HPB also developed a training standards \\nand compliance framework for swab personnel in June 2020.  Swab personnel \\nwere required to pass specific competency assessments before they were deployed. \\n \\nTo manage the large number of swab personnel, HPB implemented an IT system in \\nSeptember 2020 to manage the deployment, work schedules and human resource \\nfunctions (e.g. leave administration) of swab personnel.\\nAs for SLA, it conducted a re-quote exercise with hotels about five months after \\nit procured the first batch of hotel rooms, to obtain better rates.  During the period \\nDecember 2020 to January 2021, SLA also implemented a retainer basis model \\nwhere hotels were paid only when they were activated to provide accommodation \\nfacilities.  SLA also converted some of its Build and Run facilities to a step-down \\nstate in January 2021.  These measures helped SLA reduce costs. \\nAs the COVID-19 situation stabilised, MOM conducted reviews of its contracts \\nto reduce the scope of services when requirements changed.  In addition, after the \\nneed for EP had eased off, MOM made an open call in GeBIZ in June 2020 to invite \\ncaterers to submit quotations for the supply of meals to Migrant Worker dormitories. \\n \\nBoth measures led to a reduction in costs.  \\n\",\n",
      "    \"10\": \"10\\nOverview\\nConcluding Remarks \\nFrom the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, public sector agencies had to adapt and \\nrespond quickly to manage the crisis.  The speed, scale and complexity of operations \\nwere unprecedented.  AGO\\u2019s thematic audit of COVID-19 related procurement and \\nexpenditure at HPB, SLA and MOM found that all three agencies generally had \\nprocesses in place across the procurement and contract management stages.\\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic transits to a different phase, it is important for the \\npublic sector to reflect on lessons learnt so as to improve the procurement process \\nfor future emergency situations. \\nEven as swift action is needed in an emergency, the need for good financialgovernance \\nis not reduced.  There is therefore a need to consider what would be \\u201cfit for purpose\\u201d \\ngovernance mechanisms in an emergency, including what constitutes a reasonable \\nlevel of accountability and oversight. \\nIn this regard, AGO would like to offer the following learning points: \\na.\\t\\nEstablish a reasonable level of governance and planning arrangements \\nfor use in an emergency\\nThe EP which was centrally activated at the WOG level covered the \\nprocurement stage of the \\u201cprocure to pay\\u201d lifecycle.  It may be useful to \\nlook at the entire lifecycle comprising procurement, contract management \\nand payment, and consider \\u201cfit for purpose\\u201d governance arrangements in an \\nemergency to help agencies manage the entire lifecycle while adhering to the \\nbasic principles of Government procurement and financial controls.\\nAreas that will benefit from more guidance include: \\ni.\\t\\nEvaluation of contractors (including price reasonableness of their \\nbids) for goods/services procured through EP;\\n  \\nii.\\t\\nContracting for flexible and scalable quantities as demand is often \\nunpredictable in an emergency;\\niii.\\t\\nEstablishing the minimum terms and conditions that should be included \\nin contracts and agreements to safeguard the Government\\u2019s interest; and\\n\",\n",

Such front-line and operational functions should be \\ncomplemented by effective corporate functions which are critical in a crisis. \\nCentral agencies may wish to consider how critical support functions such \\nas procurement, finance and human resource can be better organised at the \\nWOG or cluster/agency level, and what detailed guidance to give agencies \\nin these areas. \\n  \\nc.\\t\\nMaintain appropriate records and document key decisions and transactions \\nThe high volume of financial transactions and the need to expedite payments to \\ncontractors may cause agencies to accept payment claims without performing \\nadequate checks or to accept claims which are not substantiated by relevant \\nsupporting documents.

During the \\nperiod December 2020 to January 2021, SLA also implemented a \\nretainer basis model to contract with hotels.  SLA awarded 32 contracts \\n(approved procurement value (APV) totalling $328.25 million) on \\na retainer basis where hotels would be paid only when they were \\nactivated to provide accommodation facilities.
