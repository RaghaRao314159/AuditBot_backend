       "### Key Findings on Grant Evaluation and Management:\n",
       "1. **Approval Processes**: The audit examined whether there was a closed-loop framework for grant management, namely the processes for inviting, receiving, and approving applications, as well as the contract management with recipients. Deficiencies in these processes were noted, leading to concerns about whether due processes were followed (AGO, 2019-20, PART III, p. 8, THEIC).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Implementation and Monitoring**: The AGO found inadequacies in managing grants, including whether they were managed with the relevant terms and conditions, whether the intended outcomes were achieved, and whether grant relevance was reviewed periodically (AGO, 2019-20, PART III, p. 8, THEIC). Specific observations included instances of non-compliance with agreed conditions, leading to inefficiencies and potential wastage.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **COVID-19 Related Grants**: The audit noted particular irregularities in the disbursement of COVID-19 related grants under schemes like RCG and RSS. Issues included:\n",
       "   - Revenue eligibility assessment for automatic grant allotment not being fully in accordance with legislative requirements or implementation documents.\n",
       "   - Manual grant assessments that were inadequately substantiated.\n",
       "   - Wrong eligibility assessments and incorrect computation of grant amounts (AGO, 2019-20, PART III, p. 51, THEMATIC AUDIT).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Contract Management**: There were inconsistencies in adhering to contract and financial management guidelines, reinforcing the need for stricter adherence to established protocols (AGO, 2019-20, PART III, p. 8, THEIC).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendations:\n",
       "The AGO recommended that ministries and agencies must strengthen their evaluation and management processes for grants to ensure better compliance, transparency, and accountability.

       "- **Inadequate Monitoring and Lapses on Checks for Grant Eligibility:** Estimated overpayment of $2,587,800.\n",
       "- **Inadequate Checks by Service Provider on Grant Claims:** Estimated overpayment of $953,600.\n",
       "- **Grants Disbursed for Ineligible Individuals and Companies:** Total discrepancy of $269,100.\n",
       "- **Grants Disbursed for Individuals with Overlapping Attendance Records:** Total discrepancy of $3,290,800.\n",
       "- **Inadequate Checks/Supporting Documents for Absentee Payroll Funding:** Overpayment reported as $393,700 out of $615,100 in total [2021_22, pp. 39, 4].\n",

       "**Year:** 2019-20  \n",
       "**Audit Findings:**  \n",
       "- **Oversight and Consistency Issues:** Need to strengthen oversight of Programme Partners (PPs) administering grants on behalf of Workforce Singapore (WSG) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG). Baseline requirements should be met to reduce inconsistencies [2019_20, pp. 56, 58].\n",
       "- **Improvement in Records:** Ensure key grant information on applications and disbursements is correctly maintained [2019_20, p. 61].\n",
       "- **Possible Circumvention and Fraudulent Claims:** Not aggregating similar applications from the same company might have bypassed stringent controls, leading to potential misuse. For instance, one company received approvals for 10 grant applications with a cumulative value of $945,000 within a six-month period, evading higher-level review thresholds [2019_20, p. 65].\n",
       "\n",

       "**Year:** 2014-15  \n",
       "**Audit Findings:**  \n",
       "- **Lapses in Grant Administration:** Identified issues with timely reviews, which are crucial for accountability and avoiding wastage. Projects that do not show satisfactory progress should be addressed promptly [2014_15, p. 18].\n",
       "- **Disbursement Monitoring Issues:** AGO reviewed the administration of multiple grant schemes like the Proof-of-Concept (POC), Competitive Research Programme (CRP), and NRF Fellowship Scheme, highlighting the need for stringent monitoring mechanisms [2014_15, pp. 17, 4].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Sector-wide Recommendations\n",
       "- **Strengthening Vetting Procedures:** Enhance evaluation of grant applications to ensure accurate eligibility assessments and correct computation of grant quantum [2022_23, p. 63; 2017_18, p. 45].\n",
       "- **Thorough Review Processes:** Emphasized need for timely reviews of progress and final reports to ensure grants are used as intended and any unutilised funds are recovered [2017_18, p. 50; 2014_15, p. 56].\n",
       "- **Enhanced Accountability:** Ensure that adequate controls and monitoring mechanisms are in place to track the use and effectiveness of grants, thereby ensuring they meet their intended purposes [2015_17, p. 4; 2014_15, p. 3].\n",
       "\n",

       "**Recurring Issues**:\n",
       "1. **Inadequate Monitoring and Administration**:\n",
       "    - Lapses in monitoring and reviewing progress and final reports, with specific examples from Workforce Singapore and ESG regarding fraudulent claims and circumvention of eligibility criteria (Year 2017-18, Page 45; Year 2019-20, Page 65).\n",
       "    - Gaps in management of R&D grants administered by A*STAR and NRF, including the need for stringent controls and auditing of unutilised funds (Year 2017-18, Page 8; Year 2014-15, Page 17).\n",
       "    \n",
       "2. **Processes and Controls**:\n",
       "    - Strengthened controls and timely approvals were highlighted across various ministries, emphasizing the need for accurate disbursement and stringent record maintenance (Year 2018-19, Page 4; Year 2019-20, Page 61).\n",
       "    - Fair and equitable grant administration, with a customer-centric approach to reduce the burden on applicants, as noted with ESG's approach for industry-specific grants (Year 2019-20, Page 58).\n",

       "*(Sources: Various, as cited)*\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Improving Oversight and Documentation**: Implementing robust oversight mechanisms and maintaining comprehensive documentation to prevent overpayments and ensure accountability.\n",
       "2. **Strengthening Controls and Verification**: Enhancing the verification processes for grant eligibility and supporting documents to minimize fraudulent claims and misuse of funds.\n",
       "3. **Timeliness and Recovery**: Ensuring timely reviews and recovery of unutilised funds to prevent wastage of public resources.\n",
       "\n",
       "These findings demonstrate consistent challenges in the monitoring, administration, and evaluation of grants across various government agencies and statutory boards, indicating a need for systemic improvements to enhance public accountability and efficient use of government funds."
